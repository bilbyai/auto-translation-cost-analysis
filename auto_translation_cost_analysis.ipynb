      "With the box office success of \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child,\" a number of alleged copyright infringement incidents have surfaced. Several lawyers, in interviews with the media, have stated that producing or selling dolls, stationery, and other items featuring Ne Zha’s image without permission, as well as using movie elements in store decorations and advertisements without authorization, all constitute infringement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In today’s era of high traffic, riding the wave of hot trends has become a common marketing tactic. Businesses leverage the influence of trending topics and popular film and television works to attract consumer attention and thereby increase their brand awareness and product sales. Right now, \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child\" is a genuine megahit, becoming a major IP. Some cultural and tourism departments, businesses, and online celebrities are capitalizing on the \"Ne Zha\" craze, using Ne Zha’s image to promote tourism, developing Ne Zha-themed merchandise, and engaging in secondary creations related to the movie. In themselves, these actions are not necessarily objectionable—they can meet public demand to a certain extent. However, riding the \"Ne Zha\" wave must be based on legality and compliance, and must not undermine the copyright holder’s lawful rights and interests. Respecting the boundaries of law and common sense is the fundamental bottom line that cannot be crossed.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, some businesses are using \"Ne Zha\" for their own gain, even seeking to profit off it. Without authorization from the copyright holders of \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child,\" they are producing and selling merchandise, such as dolls and stationery, featuring Ne Zha’s image, and are using movie elements in store decorations and advertisements without consent. These actions are suspected of infringing upon the movie’s copyright. The original Ne Zha character created for \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child,\" as well as the derivative products developed from it, are legally protected and cannot be arbitrarily copied or infringed upon by others. Even for the purpose of public interest, such as promoting cultural and tourism resources, using Ne Zha’s image must adhere to the principle of \"reasonable scope\" and must not be for commercial profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the relevant provisions of the Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China, copyright holders enjoy the rights of reproduction, exhibition, performance, etc. Among these, the right of reproduction refers to making one or more copies of a work by means of printing, photocopying, rubbing, recording, video recording, re-filming, digitizing, etc. Acts of infringement include \"reproducing, distributing, performing, showing, broadcasting, compiling, or disseminating works to the public via information networks without the permission of the copyright owner.\" Depending on the circumstances, the infringer should bear civil liabilities, such as ceasing the infringement, eliminating ill effects, providing an apology, and compensating for losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although \"Ne Zha\" is portrayed with \"three heads and six arms,\" stopping infringements capitalizing on the \"Ne Zha\" craze still requires market regulators to take timely and lawful action, saying \"no\" to such unlawful behavior and effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the copyright holders of \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child.\" Protecting the rights of the copyright holders will also facilitate the creation of more high-quality \"Ne Zha\" works.\n",

      "In summary, there are boundaries to riding the \"Ne Zha\" wave; one must not violate the law or infringe upon others’ rights.\n",

      "“From value-added tax (VAT) invoice data, we can see that Liaoning’s economic performance in the first four months of this year had numerous highlights,” said an official from the Liaoning Provincial Taxation Bureau of the State Taxation Administration in an interview with our reporter on May 23. The most notable achievements include the vigorous development of strategic emerging industries, accelerated advancement of high-end manufacturing, the continually rising role of consumption in driving economic growth, and further optimization of the green energy structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "VAT invoice data encompasses all stages including production, circulation, and services, and provides especially comprehensive records of inter-enterprise transactions. These data can reflect the economic development of different enterprises, industries, and regions in a timely and accurate manner, thereby presenting a relatively complete picture of their operation status. As a result, VAT invoices are often referred to in the industry as the “barometer” of economic operation and the “compass” for policy optimization. In recent years, the provincial tax bureau has focused on a series of evaluation indicators in VAT invoice management to ensure tax compliance, and the accuracy and comprehensiveness of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of invoiced amounts, our province has focused on key heights in industrial development, using sci-tech innovation to drive industrial innovation, accelerating the cultivation of new productive forces, and promoting the intelligent transformation of traditional industries alongside the innovation of emerging industries, resulting in the vigorous growth of strategic emerging industries. In the first four months, invoiced amounts for the electronic core industry, advanced environmental protection industry, new energy vehicle facilities manufacturing, internet and cloud computing, big data services, and marine engineering equipment industry all saw year-on-year growth of 37.7%, 26.5%, 24.4%, 23.5%, and 17% respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pace of high-end manufacturing is also accelerating,” reported the director of the Tax Revenue Economic Analysis Division of the provincial tax bureau. From January to April, invoiced amounts in the manufacture of medical instruments and equipment, as well as the aerospace industry, rose by 13.6% and 1.2% year-on-year respectively. Among them, Neusoft Medical Systems Co., Ltd. saw its invoiced amount grow by more than 30% year-on-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since the beginning of this year, policies encouraging the replacement of old products with new ones have been boosting our sales, and our monthly invoiced amounts are on the rise,” said Li Tiejun, financial director of Shenyang JD Century Trading Ltd. According to his observations, many of their industry peers have experienced similar trends, with increased market enthusiasm for consumption. The data supports this view: in the first four months, the invoiced amount for retail of home audio-visual equipment such as TVs, and daily household appliances such as refrigerators, grew year-on-year by 45.6% and 44.7% respectively. Retail invoiced amounts of communication equipment such as mobile phones, and digital and other electronic products, rose by 15.3% and 5.9% respectively. Total invoiced amounts across the consumer sector (excluding housing consumption) rose 6.4% year-on-year, an increase of 0.2 percentage points over Q1, driving overall invoice growth in the province by 0.6 percentage points. “This is connected to our province’s strategy this year to expand domestic demand, focus on key areas of consumption promotion, and actively create new integrated consumption scenarios in culture, sports, and tourism.” Professor Liang Qidong of Liaoning University noted that the province’s consumption structure is undergoing an upgrade, further raising market activity and strengthening the role of consumption in stimulating the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, this year the province has continued to steadfastly pursue high-quality development with ecological priorities and a green, low-carbon orientation. The transition to greener development continues, with a gradually forming green industrial system and further optimization of the green energy structure. In the first four months, the growth rate of invoiced amounts for five clean energy sectors—nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, and biomass—was 2.3 percentage points higher than that of thermal power, making up 35.7% of all power generation invoices, 4 percentage points above the national average. Investment in green transformation has increased, with invoiced amounts for energy-saving and new energy technology services rising by 8.1% and 3.4% year-on-year, respectively.\n",

All faculty and students uphold the fine tradition of \"diligent study and hard work, achieving self-reliance and helping others,\" as well as the core values summarized as \"promoting agricultural science and enlightening the nation.\" The university takes upon itself the important mission of serving local economic and social development. In the new era, Huazhong Agricultural University remains mindful of General Secretary Xi Jinping's earnest exhortation to \"walk together with the motherland and dedicate oneself to the people.\" Anchoring itself in the fundamental goal of fostering virtue and talent, and committed to strengthening and revitalizing agriculture, the university leverages its scientific research and talent resources to vigorously promote close integration of agriculture, science, and education, and effective connections between industry, academia, and research. It purposefully organizes and guides faculty and students to the frontlines of rural areas (\"three rural\" issues) to solve real-world problems, actively facilitating the comprehensive advancement of the rural revitalization strategy.\n",

      "Building a New-Era System of Practical and Academic Education to Cultivate \"Understanding and Loving Agriculture\" Talent  \n",
      "In keeping with the needs of modern agricultural development and ecological civilization, Huazhong Agricultural University seeks to cultivate a new generation of talent that is ready to shoulder the task of national rejuvenation, understands and loves agriculture, and is dedicated to strengthening and revitalizing the agricultural sector. The university emphasizes value-driven education and carries forward the spirit of practical farming and academic study. It promotes the study of \"Four Histories\" (the history of the Party, New China, reform and opening up, and socialist development), agricultural history, and university history, and passes down the spirit of integrating theory with practice. Through 403 model ideological and political theory courses led by 352 Party members, the university fosters students’ attachment to and understanding of agriculture.  \n",
      "The curriculum blends general and specialized education, enhancing the practice-oriented courses. This includes 25 \"Farming and Reading China\" courses, 18 farming culture courses, six classics reading courses, and 20 practical demonstration classes. The university's Party secretary and president personally lead courses on \"Farming and Reading China\" and \"Green China.\" It established the country’s first undergraduate major in smart agriculture, achieving in-depth interdisciplinary integration based on traditional agricultural disciplines. The university upgraded its 439-acre on-campus educational base, building a series of practical education bases both on and off campus.\n",

      "Vigorously Promoting Volunteer Service Spirit: Walking with the Nation and Dedicating to the People  \n",
      "Inspired by Xu Benyu, an alumnus who was named a “Person Who Touched China,” a culture of volunteerism has become an important hallmark of Huazhong Agricultural University, playing a unique role in talent cultivation. For twenty years, from the Min Gong Public School in Gou Diao Yan Village, Maocang Town, Dafang County, Guizhou Province, to the Mofeng Central Primary School in Jianshi County, Hubei Province, generations of students have remained committed to the spirit of “walking with the nation and dedicating to the people.” Through their continued efforts, they have made contributions to the growth and success of local students, grassroots educational poverty alleviation, and even changed the lives of many children—demonstrating the sense of responsibility and achievements that define youth in the new era.  \n",
      "Today, Huazhong Agricultural University is building a comprehensive volunteer education system, focusing on social needs, improving the precision of services, and constructing the \"Ben Yu Volunteer Service Team\" system with educational poverty alleviation as the core, industrial support as the engine, and cultural enrichment as the foundation.\n",

      "Exploring New Models for Universities to Aid Rural Revitalization and Advance High-Quality Agricultural and Rural Development  \n",
      "Huazhong Agricultural University remains steadfast in focusing on agriculture, leveraging its strengths, and addressing the country's strategic needs. The university emphasizes the integration of serving the \"top\" (cutting-edge research) and the \"ground\" (practical demands), combining talent cultivation, scientific research, cultural transmission, and the service of agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. In 2020, the university launched the \"Jingchu Rural Revitalization Initiative,\" guiding faculty and students to immerse themselves in the frontlines and implement the following five major actions: agricultural industry service, technological achievement transformation in Hubei, research and advocacy services in Hubei, Jingchu talent training, and promoting employment and entrepreneurship in Hubei.  \n",
      "Over the past two years, more than 600 faculty members and over 3,000 students have proactively connected with 17 cities and prefectures in Hubei province, making full use of their scientific and educational advantages to carry out technology services, talent training, theoretical advocacy, and thematic research. In doing so, they have assisted agricultural management entities, transformed agricultural technological achievements, strengthened key characteristic industries, and cultivated a new generation of youth deeply engaged and passionate about agriculture, thus contributing greatly to the high-quality development of agriculture and rural areas in Hubei.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agricultural universities were born for agriculture and are honored by strengthening it; providing robust technology and talent support for agricultural and rural modernization is the original aspiration and fundamental mission of such institutions. In the future, Huazhong Agricultural University will continue to take strengthening and revitalizing agriculture as its mission, root itself in China’s soil to build a world-class university with Chinese characteristics, fully serve the national rural revitalization strategy and agricultural modernization, consciously serve society, accelerate the integration of government, enterprise, and academia, and better cultivate talent. More teachers and students will be encouraged to enter the frontlines of modern agriculture and write a new chapter in rural revitalization for the new era.\n",

      "\n",
      "Implementation Measures (Trial) for Childcare Subsidies in Hangzhou\n",
      "\n",
      "To thoroughly implement the spirit of the “Decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Optimizing Birth Policies and Promoting Long-term Balanced Population Development,” the “Implementation Opinions of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and People’s Government on Optimizing Birth Policies and Promoting Long-term Balanced Population Development,” and the “Notice of the CPC Hangzhou Municipal Committee and Hangzhou Municipal People’s Government,” and to further improve supporting measures for birth policies and alleviate the burden of childbirth and upbringing on families, these measures are formulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Types and Forms of Subsidies  \n",

      "\n",
      "A. Pregnancy and Childbirth Subsidy  \n",
      "1. Target: Hangzhou-registered pregnant (or delivering) women who are pregnant with (or have delivered) a second or third child by the same couple since January 1, 2023.  \n",

      "II. Fund Guarantee  \n",
      "The funds for pregnancy/childbirth and childcare subsidies shall be borne by each district, county, or city (within Hangzhou). Of the childcare subsidy, the municipal finance will subsidize no more than 20% of the actual subsidy amount paid by the district, county, or city. Subsidy funds should be included in the annual budget to ensure timely disbursement.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Subsidy Implementation Process  \n",
      "A. Application Submission  \n",
      "Applicants use the mobile app “Zheli Ban”—“Healthy Hangzhou”—“Good Childcare in Hangzhou”—“Pregnancy and Childbirth Subsidy” or “Childcare Subsidy” to initiate and submit their application as prompted.\n",

Certification information is obtained via the shared data platform. Applicants can check the review progress in the system, and will receive the result via the platform. If additional information is required or there are questions, staff will promptly contact the applicant to request supplementary documentation or clarification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pregnancy/childbirth subsidy documentation includes: Both spouses’ ID cards, marriage certificate, woman’s household registration (hukou) proof, existing children's birth certificates, and household registration, etc.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Clearing follower counts, suspending or closing live streaming, user tipping, knowledge-based payment, and earnings withdrawal privileges; taking down product links; canceling advertising revenue and traffic sharing... According to the Cyberspace Administration of China, in line with the 2023 \"Clean and Bright\" series of special operations, a two-month-long \"Clean and Bright: Strict Rectification of 'Self-Media' Chaos\" campaign was launched starting March 12. One major highlight of this operation is guiding website platforms to utilize economic measures to severely crack down on illegal profiteering self-media accounts. Such thorough and deep-rooted measures once again demonstrate the resolve and determination of the Cyberspace Administration to clean up problematic accounts and foster a healthy online environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, self-media has surged, bringing richer and more entertaining content to internet users; those working in self-media have found opportunities for low-threshold employment and entrepreneurship, realizing their self-worth. Regrettably, accompanying this new communication ecology is a wave of mixed-quality content and chaotic phenomena. Fabricating rumors, distorting the truth, and malicious hype are common tricks among many self-media accounts. Some even distort interpretations of public policies to ride on hot topics, fabricate fake stories to stir up antagonistic emotions, impersonate government, military, public institutions, and news media to release fake news; others quote out of context in their commentary, plagiarize original content, or trick netizens into making donations… For example, in recent days, there was the case of a \"legendary top student\" who played with web traffic by claiming to have withdrawn from Tsinghua University because he didn't like it and then was admitted to Peking University, gaining over 500,000 likes. However, sharp-eyed netizens quickly pointed out this was just a trick involving stolen photos and lies. Such self-media rumors not only bring great distress to the people involved but also undermine the credibility of the government; they disrupt internet order and create chaos in society as well. The commercial logic of these self-media accounts is all about chasing hype, harvesting traffic, amassing followers, and monetizing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the country has continuously improved its regulatory systems and upgraded technological methods to strike at self-media chaos. The main reasons why these issues persist are, first, a philosophy of \"putting economic interests above all else,\" with some disregarding public morals and the law in pursuit of monetization; and second, some platforms turn a blind eye to problematic accounts—while establishing rules, they are reluctant to strictly enforce them. In the eyes of certain self-media creators and operators, truth, reason, civility, rules, and values all pale in comparison to the importance of web traffic, for behind the traffic lies irresistible real money.\n",
      "\n",
      "To eradicate the malpractice of illicit operations and traffic fraud within self-media, economic means are undoubtedly the most direct and effective approach. This special campaign imposes stricter penalties against \"undisciplined self-media\" at a higher level—for example, resetting the huge follower counts built up through deception to zero, disabling account withdrawals, and canceling ad revenue and traffic sharing. Like removing fuel from under the cauldron, it directly severs the financial lifeline of accounts that stir up trouble, serving as the harshest punishment for those who persistently cross the line without bottom lines. It is hoped that all platforms will strictly follow the implementation, actively embrace their responsibilities, and act in accordance with regulations, leaving no more opportunities for troublemaking by self-media accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strike at the snake, hit its seven-inch vital spot. For self-media accounts that recklessly write and post, ignore public order and decency, or violate the law, only by depriving them of both traffic and money can we truly curb disorderly and unchecked growth, and foster a cleaner and brighter online environment.\n",

      "Transforming mass petitioners visiting government offices into officials proactively visiting the people, and shifting from passive reception of complaints to actively addressing difficulties— the \"Pujiang Experience\" not only facilitated the shift in petition work from one-way information transfer to a two-way exchange between officials and the public, but also realized both bottom-up and top-down two-way interactions, marking a significant innovation in grassroots governance models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grassroots governance is the cornerstone of national governance. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core attaches great importance to this. General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: “The most solid support for the Party’s work is at the grassroots level, and the most prominent contradictions and problems in economic and social development and people’s livelihood are also at the grassroots. We must take strengthening the grassroots and laying the foundation as a long-term strategy and fundamental approach, and we must never slacken in this regard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, across the broad grassroots level, new situations, new problems, and new phenomena are constantly emerging. Even old problems often see “new variations.” Facing new circumstances, grassroots governance cannot respond to all changes by remaining unchanged. Instead, on the basis of upholding the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, efforts must be made to innovate governance methods and improve governance standards in a pragmatic and effective manner. The “Pujiang Experience” stands as a major innovation. Comrade Xi Jinping once summarized this innovation as “four conducive aspects”: conducive to further opening channels for communication and dialogue with the grassroots masses; conducive to face-to-face promotion of the Party’s principles, policies, and laws to the people; conducive to genuinely resolving practical issues for the people; and conducive to researching, exploring, and grasping the laws of petition work and other endeavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innovation of the \"Pujiang Experience\" addresses the urgent needs and concerns of the people, breaking through bottlenecks and difficulties in reform and development. It requires leading cadres to go deeply among the masses, to “sit on the same bench” and “gather around the same table” with the people, to learn about actual circumstances, analyze problems, and find solutions, in order to resolve the difficulties and worries of the masses. It is not confined to addressing individual cases, but rather summarizes solutions from single cases into effective approaches for resolving similar problems, elevating them to systematic understandings that can advance reform and development, thus taking new strides towards high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innovation of the \"Pujiang Experience\" has also enhanced the ability of leading cadres to serve the people and strengthened the close bond between the Party and the masses. The “Pujiang Experience” requires cadres to have the ambition to “tackle the hardest problems and aim for the furthest goals,” daring to confront challenges directly, focusing on problem-solving and conflict resolution, conducting more in-depth, case-by-case investigations and open discussions, and working with the masses to study issues, deepen mutual understanding and trust, build consensus, and ultimately unite officials and the public as one, harnessing collective strength to overcome difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, China’s development has entered a period when strategic opportunities coexist with risks and challenges, and uncertain, unpredictable factors are on the rise. Therefore, we must earnestly practice the \"Pujiang Experience,\" strengthening grassroots governance to bolster our confidence in facing complex situations. Comrade Xi Jinping once pointed out: “To do a good job of leading officials in visiting and receiving the public, the key is to strengthen leadership and organize carefully, the value lies in improving systems and long-term persistence, and the challenge is in solving problems and resolving conflicts.” To earnestly implement the \"Pujiang Experience,\" we must strengthen leadership, organize carefully, improve systems, persist in the long term, and sincerely resolve the concerns and difficulties of the masses. We must not engage in empty formalism or superficial actions; we must adhere to problem-oriented approaches and put the people first, always keeping their well-being in mind, and take public satisfaction as the fundamental criterion for evaluating our work. We must address the most pressing, direct, and realistic interests of the people, handle matters that improve people’s livelihoods with substance, matters that warm people’s hearts with meticulous care, and matters that align with public opinion effectively. We should also combine the \"Pujiang Experience\" with the “Fengqiao Experience” of resolving minor conflicts locally with the help of the masses, further advancing Party-building-led grassroots governance, forming a closed loop of grassroots governance emphasizing source governance, and promoting the modernization of the social governance system and governance capacity.\n",

      "On April 2, the United States announced the implementation of the so-called “reciprocal tariff” plan, provoking a global trade war and triggering a strong reaction in the international community, including a sharp shock to global financial markets—those of the U.S. included. China immediately and resolutely implemented the necessary countermeasures, working together with the international community in opposition to the U.S.’s tariff bullying and hegemonic behavior, and firmly defending multilateralism and economic globalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The logic behind the United States’ so-called “reciprocal tariff” policy is confused and violates basic economic principles. The U.S. calculation of tariff rates is crude and simplistic. The so-called “reciprocal tariff” rates it sets for various countries and regions are not, as claimed, based on “that country’s (or region’s) tariff rate toward the U.S. plus non-tariff barriers.” Instead, the U.S. arbitrarily uses the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with a given country (or region) to that country’s exports to the U.S. as a key basis for the “reciprocal tariff” rate—halving that ratio to determine the imposed tariff rate. This calculation method is arbitrary and lacks sound justification. The U.S. wish to achieve “zero trade deficit” is not feasible. The essence of the U.S.’s massive trade deficit lies in domestic economic imbalances. From the perspective of national economic accounting, whether a country’s current account is in surplus or deficit depends on the relationship between its savings and investment. The typical feature of the U.S. economy is low savings and high consumption; savings have long been below investment, so the U.S. must rely heavily on foreign savings through trade deficits. This is the fundamental, endogenous, structural, and persistent cause of the U.S. trade deficit. Protectionism cannot revive U.S. manufacturing, and higher tariffs will not achieve a “zero trade deficit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The so-called U.S. “reciprocal tariff” policy is a classic example of tariff bullying and violates World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The U.S. “reciprocal tariff” policy overturns the current international economic and trade order, placing U.S. interests above the common good of the international community. Its so-called “reciprocity” is deceptive and misleading, fundamentally violating the WTO’s most-favored-nation principle. The differentiated tariff rates run contrary to the WTO members’ commitment to mutual non-discrimination. These measures will not help solve the U.S.’s own issues, such as its trade deficit or industrial competitiveness, but will severely disrupt the normal international economic and trade order and undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. As soon as this U.S. policy was announced, it faced widespread criticism and opposition from the international community. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the U.S. “reciprocal tariff” policy is contrary to the goals it seeks to achieve, and the EU will take countermeasures. Brazil’s Congress passed an economic reciprocity bill authorizing the government to respond to U.S. trade barriers. Chilean President Gabriel Boric stated that this unilateral move by the U.S. government abandons all principles under the WTO framework and embraces the notion that “might makes right.” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticized the U.S. tariff policy as illogical and contrary to the foundations of the countries’ partnership. The U.S. “reciprocal tariff” policy is also unpopular domestically. U.S. capital markets plunged for several days; on April 4, all three major New York stock indices dropped by more than 5%, and the Wall Street “fear index” (VIX) soared by 46% in a single day. The market is voting with its feet, expressing deep concerns over the potential backlash from the so-called “reciprocal tariffs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s countermeasures are reasonable, justified, and lawful; it is hoped the U.S. will return to the correct path to resolving issues. In response to the U.S. “reciprocal tariff” policy, China promptly adopted necessary countermeasures to firmly defend its legitimate rights, interests, and developmental interests. China has always maintained a consistent and clear stance on the trade war: China does not wish to fight a trade war, as there are no winners in such a conflict; but China is not afraid of fighting one, and will certainly impose reciprocal countermeasures if the U.S. adopts such tariffs. The essence of China-U.S. economic and trade relations should be mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. It is normal for two major countries like China and the U.S. to have economic and trade differences. The two sides should, on the basis of mutual respect and equality, resolve their respective concerns through consultation, instead of resorting to unilateral containment, suppression, or even maximum pressure. We urge the U.S. to promptly correct its mistaken approach, strengthen communication and exchanges with China and relevant parties, and properly resolve economic and trade differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "China unswervingly upholds multilateralism and is willing to work with all countries to promote free trade and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. We are willing to work alongside major global economies and the vast developing world to reform and improve multilateral trade rules, promote the liberalization and facilitation of global trade and investment, and actively shape a friendly international economic and trade ecosystem. We will further advance independent opening-up, treat all market entities—including foreign-invested enterprises—equally, improve the foreign investment facilitation system, and ensure that foreign enterprises enjoy national treatment in areas such as access to production factors, qualification licensing, standard-setting, and government procurement. We will accelerate the expansion of a global, high-standard free trade agreement network, promote the negotiation and signing of a variety of multilateral and bilateral economic and trade agreements, and establish closer, mutually beneficial economic and trade relations with all countries, so that trading partners can better share the dividends of China’s development. We will make greater efforts to stabilize global industrial and supply chains, guide enterprises in orderly “going global,” create more local investment, job, and industrial development opportunities, and contribute to the prosperity and stability of the world economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "China has always been an anchor and safe harbor of global economic stability, and welcomes foreign enterprises to invest and do business in China. As the world’s second-largest economy, China’s contribution to global economic growth has long hovered around 30%. During past crises—whether facing the Asian financial crisis at the end of the last century or the 2008 international financial crisis—China played an important role in ensuring global economic stability. Currently, China boasts a super-large-scale market and a complete industrial system; it is the world’s second-largest consumer market, has the largest middle-income group globally, and has a solid foundation and strong resilience to cope with external risks and challenges. At the same time, China’s economy is charting a new course, accelerating the building of a modern industrial system, developing new quality productive forces to suit local conditions, and advancing manufacturing toward higher-end, digital, and green development. The rapid emergence of new technologies, products, and business models will continue to make China fertile ground for attracting foreign investment. More importantly, China has long maintained political stability and social order; the certainty of its policy environment stands in sharp contrast to the uncertainty of the external environment. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized building a new, higher-level system for an open economy, laying out a clear institutional framework for expanding high-level opening-up in the coming period. China is continuously strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for opening up, effectively implementing the Foreign Investment Law, and creating a transparent, stable, and predictable policy environment for foreign investors. Precisely because of such invaluable certainty, more and more international investors have an optimistic view of China’s market and development prospects. China welcomes enterprises from all over the world to invest and do business in China, and to jointly share the tremendous opportunities of China’s market development.\n",

      "At the end of September, the A-share market rebounded strongly after hitting a low, ushering in a robust rally, with some private equity products seeing their net value surge in a short period of time. However, the pullback in the first week after the National Day holiday was evident to all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, on October 10, Dan Bin, a high-profile billionaire private fund manager who had previously faced harsh criticism online, posted, \"I already warned on October 2!\" and, \"I was mocked for warning people about risks!\" What happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a review by Every Business Daily reporters, before the National Day holiday, Dan Bin posted on Weibo that \"some of my colleagues saw a bumper return (on September 30), making heavy bets on a newly listed stock with no price limits—one day's return was astonishing. Their gains over a few days not only erased losses for the year but even surpassed my annual earnings from US stocks.\" He added, \"After just these few days, it is very likely that Dongfang Harbor’s fund under my management will lose the crown as this year’s top 100-billion-yuan private fund.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Data from Private Placement Paipai shows that Hua'an Hexin's Hexin Lingxi No.1 recorded a 77.53% return in September, making it the monthly champion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 2, as Hong Kong stocks surged, Dan Bin posted, \"With such a surge, a crash will surely follow. This time, if you get trapped again, all mobilizable power has already been mobilized... Getting unstuck will be a long, long way off...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 4, Dan Bin shared, \"A Maotai distributor, mainly in vintage liquor, called me on WeChat, saying these past two years have been particularly tough, and he can barely hold on. Seeing the recent stock market rally, he had a sliver of hope and asked for my view. I said, if it's a major bull market, your business might be saved; watch the market levels—4,000, 5,000, and if the market can break the historic high of 6,124, you will have no worries. But I still see this as just a rebound...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast-forward to this week, and the rapid market correction in the second half of the week left both new and seasoned investors bitterly complaining. On October 10 (Thursday), Dan Bin wrote again: \"I warned about this on October 2! Who are the real patriots—the ones who hype the bull market and help foreign capital cash out, or me, who warns about risks and gets mocked for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of October 11 (Friday), he added, \"The so-called 'experts,' 'scholars,' and some self-media authors who shouted about a bull market and urged investors to pile in—shouldn't they apologize? Of course, I know most of these people will continue to be all talk and no action, deleting their posts as if nothing ever happened... But the ones who suffer most are the 'rookie' investors who bought stocks...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Below his Weibo post, some investors who listened to his warning commented, \"Thank you, President Dan. I cleared all my positions on October 8. This is the most perfect wave-trading I've ever done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his strategy going forward, Dan Bin also stated on Weibo: \"The best approach is still long-term and value investing—this is the only way for the common people to beat the market! Speculating is a zero-sum game and will most likely end in a loss! This unprecedented migration of deposits into the stock market—let’s hope for a good outcome, a slow and steady bull market, so everyone can be happy...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reporter also interviewed several private equity professionals on the outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veteran market analyst Wang Ping pointed out that the first phase of the bull market is still ongoing, but the one-sided, violent main rise has passed, and the market will turn to a period of oscillation in the short term. After large-cap stocks surged sharply and then corrected quickly, small caps, having risen more, are now correcting even more—this is normal, a correction to the overly rapid rise and nothing to worry about. Technical adjustments will provide opportunities to add or switch holdings. \"In the future, the main driving force for A-shares will come from tech stocks. We define the next bull market as an independent tech bull. The bullish trend will go through several phases, centered on different sectors at each stage, but technology should be the main theme throughout.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Bingtian, Chairman and CIO of Jintian Fund, also said that recent market volatility is a normal early-bull-market feature and remains cautiously optimistic. The market will soon exit the phase of broad-based rally and enter a period of structural divergence, putting investors' stock selection and screening skills to the test. With the Q3 earnings season coming, beware of negative surprises causing single-stock collapses. On the other hand, he suggested focusing on policy-stimulated consumer sectors and the so-called \"new quality productivities\" sector; companies with solid fundamentals will stand out. Investment directions he likes include intelligent driving and components, humanoid robots and components, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and traditional Chinese medicine OTC products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yi Xiaobin, Chief Investment Officer of Shunshi Investment, pointed out that the recent market drop is a retracement after the previous sharp rise—what goes up fast comes down fast, and with three consecutive gap-ups, it's unsustainable. He expects that after the big drop, funds will become more cautious, market excitement will cool, and post-first wave, there will be repeated oscillations and consolidation around current levels. \"We don’t think the market is over. It will transition from a fast bull to a slow bull, and styles will diverge. Growth-oriented tech companies offer the most potential and will be the main source of excess returns going forward.\"\n",

      "At 9:18 a.m. on June 28, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Jingneng Yumen Xinminbao 100 MW Wind Power EPC Project and the Qingqiji Yumen Lou’ershan 100 MW Wind Power EPC Project, both contracted by Shanghai Electric Power Construction Company, was successfully held at the Xinminbao project site. Simultaneously, the collective groundbreaking ceremony for major projects in Yumen City for June 2023 was also held here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jingneng Yumen Xinminbao 100 MW Wind Power Project and the Qingqiji Yumen Lou’ershan 100 MW Wind Power Project are located in Qingquan Township, Yumen City, Gansu Province, at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,100 meters. A total of 36 wind turbines, each with a single-unit capacity of 5.56 MW, will be installed. Two new 110 kV modular intelligent substations will be built, along with the installation of a 15 MW/60 MWh energy storage system. Upon completion, the project will effectively improve power quality and reliability. It will have a positive impact on optimizing the local energy structure, resource allocation, and alleviating the resource and environmental pressures posed by new thermal power projects. Additionally, it is expected to boost local economic development, improve economic conditions, protect the ecology, and support the healthy development of a harmonious society, bearing significant strategic importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once completed and operational, the project is expected to deliver an annual on-grid power generation of about 480 million kWh, generate annual sales revenue of approximately 140 million yuan, save 175,000 tons of standard coal per year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 68,000 tons annually. This will promote the integrated development of Yumen’s new energy industry and play a decisive role in boosting the local economy.\n",

      "Born out of reform and opening, flourishing because of reform and opening, Pudong has written a legendary chapter in China’s history of reform. “The significance of Pudong’s development lies in its role as a window and demonstration, in its courage to pioneer and experiment, and in its pioneering spirit,” Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized during his 2010 research trip to Pudong.\n",

This series of aerial photos, started in 1994, is now featured in Pudong’s 30th anniversary art exhibition and has attracted enormous attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the earliest photo, Lujiazui is filled with low buildings and dark green roofs—“like moss pressed to the ground.” At the time, Yao wondered: “Can they really build an international financial center here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, walking through the skyscrapers of Lujiazui Financial City, you feel the bustling energy of instant global asset allocation. Covering only 31.78 square kilometers, Lujiazui is home to more than 10 national-level financial markets and infrastructure, over 6,000 financial institutions, and more than 300,000 finance professionals. Capital never sleeps here, and the density of economic activity is astounding: of the area’s 285 office buildings, 102 generate over 100 million yuan in taxes, 30 exceed 1 billion yuan, and 4 even surpass 5 billion yuan.\n",

      "Although the development and opening of Pudong began relatively late, it started at a higher level—right from the beginning, it was “thinking beside a globe,” setting its sights on Pacific horizons and engaging in “calm economic conversations with the world.”\n",

      "A financial city, a science city—against the backdrop of 30 extraordinary years, these two economic highlands explain only part of Pudong’s miracle. In building international centers for economy, finance, trade, shipping, and global sci-tech innovation, Pudong is the core carrier. In 2019, Pudong’s GDP reached 1.2734 trillion yuan—211 times higher than 30 years ago; GDP per capita reached about $33,200.\n",

      "This new round of opening-up is characterized by institutional innovation, aiming to establish a system aligned with international investment and trade rules, to the highest standards.\n",

Pudong didn’t ask “can we do it?” but “should we do it?” and issued China’s first food business license combining retail and catering. Then, it added an Internet function. Now, Hema has more than 220 stores nationwide, “A reform gave birth to a new industry,” says Shen Li, Vice President of Hema (China).\n",

      "As summer vacation begins, various history exhibition halls and revolutionary memorial museums are welcoming students on holiday. Some cultural and tourism organizations are tapping into red resources and developing distinctive ideological and political courses, providing support for study tours during the holidays and attracting large numbers of participants. The Party’s century-long journey of struggle, the great changes in the new era, and the inspiring stories of heroes and role models offer precious spiritual nourishment for the healthy growth of young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as growing a tree requires nurturing its roots, cultivating virtue requires nourishing the heart. Adolescence is the “critical period” of life, a key time when worldviews, outlooks on life, and values are formed. Like a blank piece of silk, it takes on the color it is dyed. Revolution tradition education that deeply fosters feelings of love for the Party, the country, and socialism can help youth fasten the “first button” of life, establish firm beliefs, cultivate noble souls, and develop good character. To educate people, we must first shape their hearts. It is necessary to promote innovation in content, forms, and methods based on the physical and psychological characteristics of young people, continuously enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of red education. Red culture should be integrated into daily life to nurture youth, ensuring every sapling receives attentive guidance and cultivation, growing strong and healthy in the sunshine of the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Party’s history is the most vivid and convincing textbook, and an essential resource for nurturing a new generation capable of shouldering the great task of national rejuvenation. Through a century of arduous struggle, the Party and the people have composed the most magnificent epic in the millennia-long history of the Chinese nation, restoring glory to Chinese civilization. We must give full play to the essential role of Party history in fostering virtue and education, guiding students to know and love the Party and the country, deepening their understanding of historical processes, grasp of historical laws, and use of historical wisdom. This will help young people strengthen their historical and cultural confidence, boost their ambition, backbone, and conviction, and contribute their youthful strength with greater enthusiasm and optimism to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red is a color symbolizing light and warmth, as well as revolution and victory. The reason this red shines so brightly is because it is infused with the light of ideals, like Qu Qiubai’s desire to “open a bright path for all”; the spirit of sacrifice, like Zhao Yiman’s “Never begrudge my head for a new homeland, gladly giving my blood to nurture China”; the caring for the people, like Jiao Yulu’s “Helping and caring for the people when they need it most”; and the integrity and self-discipline, like Yang Shanzhou’s “Don’t treat me as a shade tree to shelter under.” One great name after another and one moving story after another set fine examples for young people. Inheriting the red gene means choosing a life path that is active, upward, and full of strength. With ideals in mind and great ambitions, while also being down-to-earth and hardworking, bravely striving at the forefront of the times as pioneers and contributors, only then can youth grow into pillars of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red is the fundamental color of virtue, character, and achievement. Red traditions and genes will never become obsolete. When the red seed takes root deeply in the hearts of young people, it will nourish an unwavering faith and a passionate patriotism. Today’s youth are the successors and future main force for building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. By guiding the younger generation in the new era to integrate the red gene into their very blood and make it the foundation of their life’s struggle, the future picture of the Chinese Dream and the Dream of a Strong Nation will surely be splendid and magnificent.\n",

      "Hong Kong Wen Wei Po reported—According to China News Service, the Ministry of National Defense held a regular press conference on the 26th. Spokesperson Wu Qian stated that China demands the Philippine side stop infringing on China's sovereignty and cease provocative behavior to avoid further escalation and deterioration of the situation. He urged the US side to stop interfering in South China Sea affairs and to stop fueling the situation and undermining regional peace and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reporter asked: Not long ago, Chinese and Philippine ships had a minor collision near Ren’ai Reef. The Philippine Defense Secretary claimed that China's actions seriously violated international law. The Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines said that although China expelled Philippine vessels from the South China Sea, the resupply to the grounded warship “BRP Sierra Madre” at Ren’ai Reef would still proceed. The US National Security Advisor reiterated US support for the Philippines and emphasized that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the Philippine Coast Guard. What are your comments on this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Qian responded that the China Coast Guard and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have issued information several times, promptly disclosing the facts and video evidence. The origins of the incident are clear, the facts are evident, and the evidence is conclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Qian pointed out that China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha (Spratly) Islands, including Ren’ai Reef and its adjacent waters. This sovereignty was established through a long historical process and is consistent with international law, including the United Nations Charter. Disregarding China's repeated dissuasion and warnings, Philippine vessels insisted on violating China's rights and provoking incidents, intentionally creating trouble. They dangerously maneuvered to cross in front of the China Coast Guard ship on normal law enforcement duty, and the Philippine Coast Guard vessel deliberately reversed into a stationary and drifting Chinese fishing boat, putting personnel on both sides in danger. The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side.\n",

      "“In response to the Philippine side’s provocation, the China Coast Guard took countermeasures in accordance with the law, firmly safeguarding territorial sovereignty. The actions taken on site were justified, lawful, professional, and regulated.

China firmly opposes this,” Wu Qian emphasized.\n",

      "With the release of New China Life Insurance’s (NCI) 2022 annual results, the 2022 performance report cards of the five largest A-share listed insurance companies have been unveiled. On March 30, Beijing Business Today reported that in 2022, the combined net profit attributable to the parent companies of the five major listed insurers reached 174.671 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 19.06%, averaging about 479 million yuan in profit per day. Due to the impact of market volatility and a downward trend, investment performance was lackluster, with the five insurers reporting total investment income of 468.157 billion yuan, down 18.15% year-on-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the liability side, as the transformation of life insurance moves into deeper waters, and under the grim and complex market environment, the value growth of new business for listed life insurers continues to be pressured. Some companies are focusing on diversified operations, emphasizing the development of bancassurance and other channels. In the property insurance segment, auto insurance premiums have rebounded, and the proportion of non-auto business has further increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investment Drags Down Net Profit\n",
      "Clear Asset Allocation Profile\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data compiled by Beijing Business Today, in 2022, the combined net profit attributable to shareholders of the five listed insurance companies was 174.671 billion yuan, down 19.06% year-on-year, averaging about 479 million yuan in daily profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of profitability, one out of the five listed insurers saw an increase in net profit, with the other four experiencing declines. In 2022, Ping An of China’s net profit attributable to the parent was 83.774 billion yuan, maintaining its top rank among the five companies. China Life, PICC, China Pacific Insurance (CPIC), and New China Life achieved net profits of 32.082 billion yuan, 24.406 billion yuan, 24.609 billion yuan, and 9.8 billion yuan, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, interest rates continued to fall and the stock market became increasingly volatile. Amid complex investment conditions, the five listed insurers achieved a total investment income of 468.157 billion yuan, an 18.15% decline from the previous year. In terms of investment returns, their total investment yield ranged between 2.5% and 4.6%, with net investment yields between 3.94% and 5.1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the investment strategies of these insurers for 2023? In terms of allocation, investments in debt-type financial assets and equity assets remain the main focus. At China Life’s performance briefing, Vice President Liu Hui said that on the fixed-income side, the company will seize the opportunity provided by high interest rates to strengthen the fixed-income base and focus on boosting coupon yields and asset duration, allocating as much as possible to long-duration, low-risk government bonds. For equity investment, the strategy will be to stabilize investment in this area, balancing the enhancement of returns with volatility management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ping An’s Chief Investment Officer Deng Bin also disclosed that the company will maintain its strategic asset allocation while strengthening tactical allocations, including rotating among sectors, timing, and managing pace. They plan to seek out top investment managers in the market and use investment channels to create excess returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike 2022, when the insurance industry’s investment segment faced major challenges, with China’s economic recovery, insiders unanimously believe that both the asset and liability sides of the insurance industry will improve in tandem. With the rebound in the stock and bond markets in 2023, investment incomes and net profits of listed insurers are also expected to recover. According to analysis by Zheshang Securities, in the first quarter of 2023, the 10-year government bond yield hovered around 2.9%, the downward trend of the 750-day government bond yield curve eased, and the equity market performed well. Given the low base of investment income in the same period of 2022, industry investment returns are expected to rebound and support profit growth.\n",

      "Agent Headcount Hits New Low\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the deep transformation of the life insurance industry and the impact of the pandemic, companies continued to see pressure on the growth rate of new business value and premium income in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "From an operational perspective, all five of the listed insurers experienced declines in the value of new life insurance business in 2022. CPIC Life's new business value fell 31.4% to 9.205 billion yuan. PICC Life’s new business value reached 2.669 billion yuan, down 17.3% year-on-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "While individual agent channels are in decline, some insurers are actively exploring diversified distribution channels. In 2022, Ping An Life’s bancassurance channel new business value grew by 15.9% year-on-year. China Life’s bancassurance channel also saw rapid growth in both premium scale and business value, with a total bancassurance premium of 63.415 billion yuan, up 28.6% year-on-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the industry enters a critical phase of transformation, life insurers have voluntarily cut back on under-performing agents and are driving their agent workforce towards higher quality, professionalism, and efficiency. In 2022, the headcount of agents at listed insurers hit new lows. The average monthly number of CPIC Life insurance agents was 279,000, down 46.9% year-on-year; PICC Life’s large individual insurance agents totaled 97,400 by the end of 2022, representing a drop of 47.61%.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the agent workforce transformation entering its latter stages, transformative results are becoming apparent. For instance, at Ping An Life, the average new business value per agent increased by 22.1% year-on-year in 2022, and operating profit from life and health insurance rose by 16.4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From these figures, it seems the decline in agent headcount has started to stabilize,” said Song Zhanjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Insurance Research Institute at Beijing Technology and Business University. Reinsurance companies’ analyses suggest three million insurance agents could meet consumer demand for insurance in China. Based on the current agent workforce, the next step is to further improve agent productivity and retention rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding industry development in 2023, China Life Chairman Bai Tao stated: “First, industry recovery is accelerating; second, industry transformation is speeding up; third, positive factors supporting industry value growth are forming more rapidly; fourth, the core backbone and per capita productivity of sales teams remain stable, laying a solid foundation for recovery; fifth, bancassurance is gaining momentum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bai Tao also noted that driven by new forces such as marketing system reform, digital operations, comprehensive development, and ecosystem building, the life insurance industry is seeing structural and long-term growth opportunities open up.\n",

      "Auto Insurance Rebounds\n",
      "Non-auto Business Share Increases Further\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the “gloomy” life insurance business, in 2022, property & casualty insurance’s “big three”—Ping An P&C, CPIC P&C, and PICC P&C—all reported growth in insurance business income. Ping An P&C and PICC P&C reported premium growth of 10.4% and 8.3%, respectively, while CPIC P&C saw income grow by 11.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of auto insurance, the reform of comprehensive auto insurance has begun to show results in “improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency.” Coupled with increased demand for automobiles in 2022, reduced vehicle claim rates, and fewer catastrophe events during the flood season, the auto insurance business of the three companies continued to recover, with auto insurance premium income growth rates all surpassing 6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the release of the “China Insurance Industry Association New Energy Vehicle Commercial Insurance Exclusive Clauses (Trial)”, the big three P&C insurers have further expanded their territory in the new energy vehicle insurance market. For example, CPIC P&C’s new energy vehicle insurance premiums grew by more than 90% in 2022, with business costs declining somewhat. PICC P&C also reported rapid growth in its new energy vehicle insurance business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, all three companies are actively expanding non-auto business to optimize their non-auto insurance premium share. Specifically, in 2022, CPIC P&C’s non-auto insurance premium income grew by 18.8% year-on-year, accounting for 43.2% of its business; PICC P&C’s non-auto business share rose to 44.1%, up 1 percentage point from last year. Industry forecasts suggest leading insurers may further expand their profit margins by leveraging advantages in pricing and distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Zhu Shaojie, insurance expert at Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, although China's vehicle ownership continues to grow, and auto insurance premium income has grown to a significant scale with it, fierce market competition has curbed the profitability of auto insurance. Whether for leading or small and mid-sized insurers, breakthroughs and new business growth points must be sought from non-auto insurance lines.\n",

President Xi Jinping attended the meeting and delivered an important speech entitled \"Shouldering the Responsibility of Our Times and Promoting Asia-Pacific Development Together\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival at the venue, Xi Jinping was warmly welcomed by President Boluarte.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech, Xi Jinping pointed out that for decades, APEC has driven major development, prosperity, and connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region, helping to make Asia-Pacific the most dynamic part of the global economy and a main engine for global growth. At present, the world is experiencing accelerating changes unseen in a century, and Asia-Pacific cooperation also faces challenges such as rising geopolitical tensions, unilateralism, and protectionism. Standing at a historical crossroads, countries in the Asia-Pacific must unite and collaborate, take up their responsibilities courageously, promote the building of an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, and strive to usher in a new era for Asia-Pacific development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi Jinping made three proposals:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, to build an open and interconnected framework for Asia-Pacific cooperation. We must uphold multilateralism and an open economy, resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, focus on advancing regional economic integration and connectivity, and maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains. Today, we will adopt a new guidance document for building the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which I believe will inject new momentum into the development of an open Asia-Pacific economy. China adheres to promoting reform through opening-up, actively aligns itself with high-standard international economic and trade rules, is committed to expanding opening-up at its own initiative, and is willing to explore and discuss digital and green trade agreements with relevant parties, continuously expanding a high-standard global free trade zone network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, to foster green and innovative growth drivers in the Asia-Pacific. We must seize the opportunities presented by a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum information, and life sciences and health, and create an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory innovation ecosystem to drive a leap in productivity in the region. We must give priority to ecological conservation, practice intensive and economical, green, and low-carbon development, promote coordinated digital and green transformations, and shape new drivers and advantages for Asia-Pacific development. China is fostering new quality productive forces suited to local conditions, deepening green and innovative cooperation with all parties, will release the Global Initiative on Facilitating Cross-Border Data Flows, and is ready to work with all parties to promote efficient, convenient, and secure cross-border data flows to contribute to high-quality development in the Asia-Pacific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, to firmly establish the vision of inclusive development in the Asia-Pacific. We must strengthen economic and technical cooperation, increase support for developing economies and vulnerable groups, expand and fairly distribute the \"cake\" of economic development, and enable more economies and people to share the fruits of development. China will, within APEC, advance initiatives to raise household income and promote cluster development of SMEs, helping Asia-Pacific economies achieve inclusive development. China will serve as APEC host in 2026 and looks forward to working with all parties to deepen Asia-Pacific cooperation and benefit the peoples of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi Jinping emphasized that reform and opening up is a historical process of joint development and progress for China and the world. The 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China’s third plenary session proposed over 300 important reform measures, making systematic plans across all areas such as building a high-level socialist market economy, promoting high-quality development, expanding high-standard opening-up, improving people's quality of life, and building a beautiful China. China's development will provide new opportunities for the Asia-Pacific and the world. China welcomes all parties to continue to ride the express train of China’s development and jointly strive for the modernization of all countries and a world of peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation, and common prosperity.\n",

Using typical traffic safety accident cases involving logistics and freight transport that have occurred in recent years, combined with real data and facts, they helped drivers clearly understand the serious consequences and potential dangers that can be caused by violating traffic laws. When explaining the key points of road traffic safety laws and regulations, the police used real cases to popularize the law, giving detailed explanations on the severe outcomes of illegal behaviors such as speeding, overloading, and fatigued driving. The focus was on guiding drivers to consciously abide by laws and regulations and practice civilized and safe driving.\n",

      "From April 14th to 15th, the “Low and Medium Yield Farmland” project promotion meeting—part of the National Key R&D Program—focusing on enhancing productivity in southern lateritic and red-yellow soils, as well as projects for young scientists and technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises, was held at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Consulting experts and scholars such as Academician Zhang Jiabao, Academician Kang Shaozhong, and Academician Shao Ming’an attended the meeting. The event featured project progress reports covering topics such as improving the productivity of low and medium yield farmland in the Yangtze River Basin, ameliorating acidic soils in southern China, and targeted regulation of soil barriers. These were reviewed and guided by an expert panel.\n",

      "National food security is not only about a “static reserve” of output, but also a “dynamic granary” of production capacity. Zhu Yongjin, Director of the Agricultural Science and Technology Office of Hubei Provincial Department of Science and Technology, introduced that Hubei is currently making orderly progress in enhancing the production capacity of “low and medium yield farmland.” Since the launch of the Ministry-Province Joint Project “Technological Models and Applications for Capacity Enhancement of Red-Yellow Soil Slope Farmland and Low and Medium Yield Rice Fields in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River,” a three-in-one technological system of “targeted diagnosis-dynamic regulation-intelligent decision-making” has been established, achieving a leap from “treating the symptoms” to “treating the root cause” and resulting in a series of key outcomes. Moving forward, there will be further efforts to strengthen full-cycle services, scenario-based promotion, and basin-wide collaboration. Using Hubei as a hub, a big data platform for arable land in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be built, enabling data sharing, joint problem diagnosis, and collaborative technology research across five provinces, thus contributing “Hubei wisdom” to the high-quality development of agriculture in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.\n",

      "Zheng Ge, Chief Agronomist of the Science and Technology Development Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that holding the promotion meeting for the National Key R&D Program’s “Low and Medium Yield Farmland” project is of great significance. It provides systematic checks for each project, distills landmark and breakthrough results, and lays the groundwork for the preliminary research and special initiatives of the 15th Five-Year Plan. He emphasized the importance of increased publicity to raise high attention toward the improvement of production capacity in low and medium yield farmlands in both the arid and semi-arid north and the southern red-yellow soil regions. Moreover, the results should be applied in practical production to truly guarantee national food security and the effective supply of agricultural products. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of talent cultivation, Zheng noted that young scientists should not only develop their skills in academic writing, but also truly engage with industry and align with the frontlines of agricultural production, contributing to the industry and becoming truly “down-to-earth” scholars.\n",

      "In mid-June, the Sino-French co-produced documentary \"Peking Man: Humanity's Last Secret\" held a \"cloud launch\" ceremony simultaneously in Beijing and Paris. Directed by French documentary filmmaker Jacques Malaterre, with French paleoanthropologist Yves Coppens serving as chief writer and scientific advisor, this film utilizes the latest scientific achievements and technological methods from both China and France to recreate the prehistoric story of Homo erectus from Asia, known as \"Peking Man.\" The documentary is set for a global release in 2021, marking the 100th anniversary of the excavation of the Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Sino-French co-produced documentary, \"A Guided Reading of the Analects,\" has also attracted much attention and is currently in production. Filming began in October 2019, with the aim of using modern perspectives and visual technology to showcase the latest research by Chinese and foreign experts and scholars on ancient texts, presenting the long history of cultural exchange between the two great civilizations of China and Europe. Since production commenced, the documentary has received widespread attention from French sinologists and lovers of Chinese culture, and it is expected to finish production by the end of this year, after which it will be broadcast simultaneously on mainstream media in both China and France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sino-French film and television cooperation has a long history. As early as 1958, the two countries collaborated on the film \"The Kite,\" which was the first color children's feature film in the new China, as well as the country's first co-produced film with a foreign partner, holding special significance in the history of Chinese cinema. The story revolves around a kite linking the friendship of Chinese and French children. After its release in France, the film attracted 860,000 viewers, won awards at the 11th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and the 19th Venice International Film Festival, and is regarded as a film that \"enhanced the friendly relations between the Chinese and French peoples.\" Marking the 60th anniversary of its release, the documentary \"Kite, Kite,\" which showcases the story of the film’s production both in front of and behind the scenes, aired on French television in 2019, bringing fond memories to French audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following \"The Kite,\" China and France maintained their film and television cooperation. For example, the 1987 co-production \"Le Voyage en Chine\" (literally \"Resentment in the Boudoir\") tells the story of a Chinese female pianist living in France and attracted more than 950,000 viewers in France; its DVD version is still on sale in France today. Other notable co-productions include 2002’s \"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\" and 2009’s \"John Rabe.\" Although the total number of co-productions has been limited, their unique storytelling methods and high production quality left a deep impression on film lovers at the time and helped foster mutual understanding between the two nations. For many French people, their initial impressions of China may have originated from these films.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, China and France signed the China-France Film Co-production Agreement, leading to a surge in joint film productions. The 2014 film \"The Nightingale,\" shot in China and post-produced in France, received high acclaim in both countries’ film circles for its artistic merit and distinctive Chinese elements. The movie was shown in France for as long as five months and was called \"the top-selling medium-to-low budget art film of 2014 in France.\" It took part in over 20 international film festivals, and film rights were sold to more than 10 countries and regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The release of \"Wolf Totem\" in 2015 marked another success in Sino-French co-produced films. Directed by famed French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, the film explores the relationship among humans, animals, and nature, telling a Chinese story from an international perspective. It received widespread acclaim in France, attracting more than 1.2 million viewers, and achieved both commercial and critical success, just like \"The Nightingale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, most Sino-French co-productions have been medium- or low-budget films with realist themes, focused on telling a good story. Although some directors, scriptwriters, and editing teams are from the French side, the stories are authentically Chinese. The film crews have explored different regions to showcase local customs and folkways, presenting Chinese elements through more meaningful expressions. Such collaboration has provided a richer, more nuanced international perspective for telling Chinese stories and has offered new possibilities for the development of Chinese cinematic art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of Sino-French film co-productions stems from notable cultural affinities between the two countries. Reports suggest that both Chinese and French cinema excel at presenting complex emotions and social conflicts, making it easy for audiences in both countries to resonate with the stories. For instance, the Chinese film \"So Long, My Son\" screened in France in 2019 told the stories of several families to convey the transformations in China, and was praised as \"both literary and visually artistic\" and as \"showing the unyielding national character of the Chinese people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jean-Christophe Sabatin-Bollans, chief representative of the Chinese Film Festival in France, sees it, this attitude of respecting other cultures and drawing nourishment from the best of different civilizations is deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese and French peoples, enabling mutual appreciation and attraction and resulting in harmonious collaboration. \"Cultural diversity is one of the key principles in Sino-French co-production,\" Sabatin explains. \"Filmmakers from both countries are full of imagination and creativity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "France is the birthplace of cinema and also one of the world’s major film hubs, while the Chinese film market has flourished in recent years, with outstanding works emerging one after another. With policy support and the diligence of talented filmmakers, Sino-French co-productions will increasingly integrate the film resources of both countries and present more touching, high-quality stories to global audiences.\n",

      "Feeding plans should be chosen based on the assessment of nutritional risks and their severity at the time of discharge and during the growth period of preterm/low birth weight infants. It is important not only to evaluate the degree of nutritional risk but also to consider factors such as feeding tolerance, growth rate and growth level, and milk intake during follow-up. The goal is to achieve optimal physical growth status through individualized adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategy of providing enriched nutritional feeding—using specially formulated, high-energy-density foods for preterm/low birth weight infants (referred to as \"enriched nutrition\")—is mainly applicable to preterm/low birth weight infants who require catch-up growth. The intensity and duration of nutrition enrichment should be determined by professionals based on the infant’s physical growth assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duration of Enriched Nutrition  \n",
      "The duration of enriched nutrition should be individualized according to the physical growth status (weight, length, head circumference) of the preterm/low birth weight infant rather than being determined solely by age or weight values. In general, specially formulated foods for preterm/low birth weight infants should be used until the infant's physical growth indicators reach the 25th–50th percentile (P25–P50) for the same sex and corrected age group. For small-for-gestational-age preterm infants, the goal is to exceed the 10th percentile (P10). Weight is typically used as the primary evaluation indicator, but attention should also be paid to length, head circumference growth, and weight-for-length status, avoiding weight-for-length above the 90th percentile (P90). Once the above targets are achieved, enriched nutrition can be gradually discontinued. During the period of enriched nutrition, the growth status of preterm/low birth weight infants should be monitored dynamically, with biochemical tests conducted if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a decline in growth rate or percentile rankings of various indicators, or if biochemical abnormalities arise, a differential diagnosis should be made. Under professional guidance, partial restoration of enriched nutrition may be considered until normal growth rates resume. Such enriched nutritional preparations—such as formulas for preterm/low birth weight infants (including in-hospital and transitional formulas)—and human milk fortifiers are mainly used for infants up to a corrected age of 6 months. If necessary, these should be used under professional supervision and generally for no longer than one year.\n",

      "The Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression was a just war to oppose the invasion, enslavement, and plundering by Japanese militarism, and to strive for national independence and liberation. It was also an important component of the worldwide War Against Fascism. In this life-and-death struggle, the Chinese people, through 14 arduous and extraordinary years of bloody combat, defeated the vicious and brutal Japanese militarist invaders, achieving China’s first complete victory against foreign aggression in modern history. The victory of the War of Resistance became a great turning point in the Chinese nation’s journey from deep crisis toward a great national revival.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance crushed the Japanese militarists’ attempts to colonize and enslave China, safeguarded national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and won an important historical opportunity for China’s revival**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since modern times, due to the invasions of foreign powers and the corruption of feudal rulers, China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society, falling into the lowest depths of its history. In particular, the barbaric invasion of Japanese militarism inflicted the most devastating disasters and deepest wounds on the Chinese people, pushing the Chinese nation step by step toward the brink of national extinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan’s consistent strategic aim since modern times was to annex China and turn it into its exclusive colony. To achieve this, for more than seventy years since the Meiji Restoration, Japan engaged in incessant militarism, initiating and participating in a series of wars of aggression against China. In 1874, Japan invaded Taiwan, and soon after forcibly incorporated China’s vassal state, the Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa), into its territory. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, after annexing Taiwan and the Penghu Islands through the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan further seized rights to station troops in southern Manchuria and the Beijing-Tianjin areas as a result of the Eight-Nation Alliance’s intervention and the Russo-Japanese War, thereby building forward positions for expanding its war of aggression in China. In 1931, Japanese militarists brazenly launched the “September 18th Incident” and occupied all of Northeast China; in 1937, they deliberately provoked the “July 7th Incident” and launched an all-out war of aggression against China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the “September 18th Incident,” during the 14 years of war, the Japanese invaders trampled upon China’s beautiful rivers and mountains as they burned, slaughtered, raped, and looted, committing countless atrocities. Politically, they fabricated the puppet “Manchukuo” to dismember China, fostered puppet regimes like that of Wang Jingwei to “rule China with Chinese,” and carried out colonial rule over Northeast China and other occupied territories. Militarily, they committed fascist atrocities, launched germ and chemical warfare, enforced the “three alls policy” (“kill all, loot all, burn all”), perpetrated the Nanjing Massacre, the Chongqing Bombing, and other tragedies, wantonly slaughtering the Chinese people. Economically, they practiced “war feeding war,” frantically plundering China’s strategic resources. Culturally, they deliberately destroyed Chinese culture, imposed slavish education policies in occupied areas, and tried to cultivate submissive “imperial subjects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The barbarity of Japanese militarist aggression provoked heroic resistance from the Chinese people. After the “September 18th Incident,” patriotic officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies, and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army led by the Chinese Communist Party initiated a war of national defense in the white mountains and black waters of the region, sparking local anti-Japanese resistance in China. Meanwhile, patriots elsewhere in China also launched courageous resistance to the Japanese invasion, such as in the Shanghai, Great Wall, Chahar, and Suiyuan campaigns. These struggles demonstrated the indomitable fighting spirit of the Chinese people, safeguarded the dignity of the Chinese nation, and struck blows against the Japanese invaders’ ambitions and arrogance. Following the national outbreak of the war, under the banner of the national united front against Japan built on CCP-Kuomintang cooperation, the Chinese people mounted a full-scale resistance. Anti-Japanese flames blazed everywhere, from within the Great Wall to south of the Yangtze. Kuomintang troops engaged the enemy on the main battlefronts; Communist-led Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies operated deep behind enemy lines, opening up vast guerilla theaters. The two fronts coordinated, forming a strategic encirclement of the Japanese forces. After more than a year of fierce fighting, Chinese soldiers and civilians shattered Japan’s plan for a swift victory and mired them in a protracted war. Through strategic stalemate and counteroffensive, the Chinese people finally defeated the Japanese invaders. On September 2, 1945, Japan signed the instrument of surrender, consigning itself to permanent disgrace in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The progress of the Chinese nation toward renewal had been repeatedly interrupted in modern times, yet the Chinese people never surrendered, never despaired, never gave up. Instead, they repeatedly overcame adversity, reformed, and set forth anew, ultimately winning the great victory of the War of Resistance. Through their tenacious struggle and enormous sacrifices, the Chinese people crushed the Japanese militarists’ designs to colonize and enslave China, thoroughly expelled these forces that had brought endless harm and suffering to the nation, and forced the return of the Northeast, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands—territories seized since the First Sino-Japanese War—thus defending sovereignty and territorial integrity and erasing the national shame of repeated defeats against foreign invaders. From then on, no invader could ever again rampage across Chinese soil. A new chapter began in the nation’s history, opening an important opportunity for China’s revival.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance greatly strengthened national identity, cohesion, and unity, further stimulated patriotic fervor, and provided an inexhaustible source of motivation for China’s revival**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese nation has a deep-rooted tradition of patriotism, upholding justice, loving peace, not fearing brute force, and dauntlessly resisting foreign aggression. During the War of Resistance, patriotism was expressed with even greater intensity, breadth, duration, and combativeness, playing a decisive role in victory. In turn, the triumph of the war further inspired patriotism, rooting it more deeply in the Chinese spirit and providing a boundless source of strength for national renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since modern times, the Chinese people have waged a series of struggles for national independence and liberation. These struggles mark a history of national awakening and spiritual elevation, which reached unprecedented heights during the War of Resistance. Confronted with the threat of national extinction, the nation’s sense of crisis and mission to save itself surged as never before. Resistance against invasion and pursuit of national salvation became the common will of parties, ethnic groups, classes, factions, and the vast numbers of compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas. Amidst the shockwaves of the war, regardless of north or south, young or old, hundreds of millions of Chinese rallied under the great flag of patriotism, uniting as one, sharing hatred for the enemy, willingly risking all, and forging an unbreakable force to fight for the nation, the motherland, and for dignity. They built a Great Wall of steel with their bodies and wrote epic poems of patriotism with heroic vigor. Throughout, the Chinese Communist Party made the pursuit of national independence and liberation its mission, championed resistance, unity, and progress, and gradually became the core leadership of the national united front, as well as the backbone of China’s revival.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this earth-shaking war of national liberation, patriotism was further elevated, typified by: putting national interests above all else and refusing to be slaves to a conquered nation; the spirit of unity and sharing national hardship; the heroism to fight the enemy to the end; the unyielding self-reliance to overcome invaders; the creativity to seek new paths of development in crisis; and the spirit of justice and self-sacrifice for world peace and progress. This great national spirit, with patriotism at its core, became the solid ideological foundation and strong spiritual pillar supporting unity and total resistance, and was the key to defeating the Japanese invaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never before in China’s history of resistance against foreign aggression was there such broad national awakening and solidarity as during the War of Resistance. The level of awakening and unity surpassed all previous struggles in modern times. As Mao Zedong observed, Japan dared to bully China largely because the Chinese people were unorganized. Once this was overcome, the Japanese invaders were confronted by hundreds of millions of awakened Chinese, like a wild ox charging into a fire, doomed to perish. The victory greatly enhanced national identity, cohesion, and unity, deepened the people’s resolve for the nation’s future and destiny, and solidified the pursuit of independence, freedom, and liberation. The great victory inspired the Chinese people to emerge from a dark era, regain national pride and self-confidence, and, under the banner of patriotism, embark on the journey of national renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The victory greatly changed China’s international image and status, reestablished its position as a major power, and created a favorable international environment for renewal**\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Opium War until the end of the War of Resistance, China was subject to humiliation and oppression by foreign powers, denied even the minimum qualification for equal dialogue in international affairs. However, the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance brought unprecedented changes in China’s international image and status.\n",
      "\n",
      "World War II, initiated by the external aggression and expansion of Japanese, German, and Italian fascism, dealt severe blows to world peace and humanity. The fascist powers became the most evil, cruel, and reactionary forces; fighting fascism was the common cause of all peoples. The Chinese people’s War of Resistance was not only a national anti-invasion struggle but also a war of global significance, opening up the main Eastern theater of the world’s anti-fascist war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese people stood at the forefront of the world’s anti-fascist war, becoming fearless trailblazers. The War of Resistance started earliest and lasted longest in China. The Chinese battlefield tied down and struck at the main forces of Japanese militarism for a prolonged period, thwarted Japan’s northern strategy against the Soviet Union, delayed its southern expansion towards the Pacific, and disrupted fascist plans to carve up the globe, strategically supporting the Allied operations. As the strategic base for Allied operations against Japan in the Asia-Pacific, China provided large amounts of strategic materials and military intelligence. The protracted struggle of the Chinese people set a shining example of the weak overcoming the strong, inspiring liberation movements worldwide. China’s significant contribution won widespread international respect and its international status was markedly enhanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "On New Year’s Day 1942, China, with the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union, signed the Declaration by United Nations. This marked the formation of the international anti-fascist alliance and China’s place as a principal member of the Allies. In the later stages of the war, China participated in the Cairo Conference with the Allies to discuss strategies against Japanese fascism, postwar issues, and the future of oppressed Asian peoples, helping formulate and sign key anti-fascist documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. To consolidate victory and safeguard postwar peace and security, China, as one of the four major anti-fascist powers, helped plan the founding of the United Nations and initiated the San Francisco Conference to draw up the UN Charter with the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union. With the Charter’s entry into force in October 1945, China became a founding UN member and a permanent Security Council member. China’s great power status, forged in the anti-fascist war, was confirmed in international law.\n",

At dawn every Sunday, my father would go out alone, wading through dew, carrying two bamboo baskets on a pole over his shoulder, walking along winding mountain paths to the deep mountains dozens of miles away to fetch coal for burning. By sunset, he would return home with two full baskets of coal in time for dinner. A tiny, apricot-sized cup had already been thoughtfully filled with wine and placed before him. He would pick up the wine, gently sip it, put it down, then lift it again for a slightly louder slurp. Only after finishing his meal and the wine, with his face flushed, did it seem as if all his fatigue and weariness had been blown away by the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that my mother would notice a few stray white hairs darting back and forth among his dark hair and exclaim, “Oh, you’ve got white hair already.” She would part his hair, carefully pluck out the white strands, and place them in his palm.\n",

In the cramped kitchen, under a bean-sized lamp, a charcoal stove stood by the wall, quietly boiling a kettle and emitting faint warmth. Our family sat around the stove for warmth. My father gazed at me and my younger brother like a shepherd watching two lovely lambs and asked, “Which of you will pull out my white hairs?

Yet each evening, with nothing else to do, we still enjoyed pulling them out—mostly because we felt we were growing up: Father sat, we stood, making us as tall as he was, for once. In this way, one cold, lonely winter night after another crept quietly past, and my brother and I shared a tacit, gleeful secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we started school, father no longer asked us to pluck his white hairs. The hardships of life and inescapable worries weighed more heavily upon him day by day. His white hairs multiplied until they covered “half his kingdom,” striking to the eye at a glance. I think, besides not wanting to distract us from our studies, perhaps even he felt resigned—letting the white hairs run riot and grow unchecked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, my father was ravaged by cancer. After a harrowing surgery, endless rounds of medication, injections, exhausting chemo and radiation therapies, his hair almost all fell out, revealing bare scalp. All his long-treasured hair was gone, and he had to start wearing hats. For some inexplicable reason, I felt that my father, stripped of hair, was like a peacock or phoenix who’d lost his feathers—lonely among the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, I suddenly mentioned plucking his white hair in childhood. My father was startled, then instantly smiled like a child. Red patches bloomed on his thin cheeks, as he basked in happy memories. After a long while, he said slowly, “You two were so naughty, always pulling out my black hairs to trick me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The secret, like a bundle, was exposed by my father so lightly that I felt somewhat embarrassed. In the face of time, my father could do nothing about growing older day by day. He tried to resist the snowfalls of life by pulling out white hairs—hoping to hold on to certain quietly departing memories before the heavy snow sealed off the mountain. It was like a farmer removing weeds to protect his crops. Yet our mischief only sped up the passage of time; we stood in stark opposition to father as accomplices and accessories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, today, as my father’s life melts away rapidly, like a snowfield in the sun, how I yearn to plant a head of black hair for him—to let him walk through the crowd proudly again, like coal ignited by sunlight.\n",

The pair of Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, and the pair of Yan Siyu and He Chao, in the women’s synchronized 10m platform and men’s synchronized 3m springboard finals respectively, delivered top-quality performances and seamless coordination.

      "At this moment, I am reminded of my alma mater, the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University. It was under the guidance and education of the entire faculty, with Mr. Liang Sicheng as department head, over six years, that I learned how to design and build houses, laying the foundation for my professional career. I have always kept in mind the teaching of former Tsinghua University President Jiang Nanxiang: “Work for the health of our motherland for fifty years.” Since graduating in 1963, I have worked in architectural design for forty-nine and a half years. In about half a year, I will have worked for fifty years. What I am proudest of is that even now, I am still drawing designs.\n",

      "I once recalled a remark from a famous figure: “If you are older and still repeating the work you did at twenty, you have regressed.” In my view, this statement is not entirely comprehensive. Nowadays, it is not easy to refine, deepen, and thoroughly master even the seemingly trivial work within a certain field, and to become a true expert. Such professionals are in great demand.

It is precisely these limitations that create a vast space for artistic creativity—just as, on the Peking Opera stage, using a riding crop to represent a real horse gives rise to the unique charm of action and dance in the art of opera. A true architect’s expertise is refined and elevated within such constraints.\n",

      "According to statistics from the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment, in October 2023, there were a total of 1,833 complaints regarding noise from construction, accounting for 57.2% of all ecological and environmental complaints citywide. Among them, the top 10 projects for construction noise complaints as well as 94 construction companies penalized for illegal noise behaviors have been publicly exposed and are subject to public supervision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise may sound minor, but it has a major impact on people’s lives. Noise pollution reaches into thousands of households, and the disturbance it causes can be inferred from the total number and proportion of complaints. In October, complaints about construction noise still accounted for “half the sky” of all ecological and environmental petition complaints in the city; compared to the previous month, the total number of complaints even increased, indicating that the battle against noise pollution remains tough and must be pursued with perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, it is clear that addressing urban noise pollution from the angle of construction noise means that Shenzhen is grasping the “bull by the horns” and targeting the crux of the problem. Construction noise pollution is the main source of urban noise pollution. As long as construction site noise is brought under control, most urban noise issues can be resolved accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shenzhen ecological and environmental authorities regularly compile statistics on public complaints and reports of noise and other pollution cases, and periodically publicize exposure lists. This timely reflection of case dynamics not only helps to keep reporting channels open and ensures citizens’ rights to know, participate and supervise, but also marks the governance of noise pollution in Shenzhen entering a lawful, institutionalized and normalized track. All project units must abandon any fluke mentality, resolutely avoid illegal noise behavior, and return a tranquil living environment to the citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "By exposing illegal noise behaviors, the intention is to shame violators for creating noise and, more fundamentally, to respect the public’s right to tranquility. Currently, Shenzhen is ramping up efforts to build a “quiet city,” with intensive introduction of policies and measures. The main purpose is to transform the public’s desire for noise reduction into policy requirements. To implement these requirements in practice, strong measures such as strict penalties and public exposure of violations are essential to safeguard public environmental rights at their core.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a tranquil city not only improves the quality of urban residents’ lives, but also reflects the “great wisdom” in urban governance and the “deep affection” for people’s well-being. The government, businesses, and the public must work together and fulfill their respective responsibilities, taking all effective measures to reduce noise pollution, promote the harmonious unity of urban development and livability, and achieve optimization and improvement of the urban environment.\n",

      "The Dragon Boat Festival is an important traditional festival in China, with a long history and rich cultural heritage. On this day, people across the country row dragon boats, make zongzi, hang calamus and mugwort, or participate in activities like reading ancient texts, cultural performances, tourism, and camping.

Upon hearing the news, people on both banks rushed in boats to rescue and recover his body, throwing zongzi into the river to feed the fish and shrimp so that they would not harm Qu Yuan’s remains. Over time, dragon boat races, eating zongzi, hanging calamus, inserting wormwood, and wearing sachets became important ways for people to commemorate Qu Yuan.\n",

      "Even after thousands of years, the feelings of Miluo people for Qu Yuan have not faded with time, but have grown stronger. Locals don’t use the official-sounding titles “Sanlü Dafu” or “Master Qu,” but instead, affectionately refer to him as “Old Master Qu” or even “Qu Daddy”—just like calling an elder in the family.\n",

Hubei Provincial Library hopes to guide readers into these texts, inspiring them to appreciate the charm of traditional culture.

      "\n",
      "“Like many traditional festivals, the Dragon Boat Festival started with rituals to ward off evil and seek blessings in midsummer. Later, commemorations for Wu Zixu, Cao E, and others enriched the festival, but what’s most important is its close connection to Qu Yuan, making it a unique festival embodying the ‘roots and soul’ of the Chinese nation,” says Liu Shilin.\n",

This year, he opened the zongzi intangible heritage museum in the Wanshou Palace district. With display and experience zones, a cooking area, and a creative gift and souvenir shop, it showcases the rice-farming culture of the Poyang Lake basin, zongzi history, and the intangible craft of making them. Cultural value transforms zongzi from a common street snack into an experience to visit, savor, and remember.\n",

      "Combining online and offline models, Yang Wenjun has seen his annual revenue jump from over 100,000 yuan to several million in four years. “Our Dragon Boat Festival culture is much more than zongzi and dragon boat races—its cultural significance runs deep. The fact that more young people choose ‘Guochao’ expresses their confidence in our traditions,” he said.\n",

Establish and improve a tiered cultivation mechanism for drone companies, emphasize both internal training and external recruitment, focus on expanding and strengthening “chain-master” and core supporting enterprises, precisely nurture local high-quality companies, support the development of specialized and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, promote agglomerated development, build industrial clusters, and create an industrial ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, technological breakthroughs must be pursued. Optimize the allocation of innovation resources, build a high-level R&D system for drone technologies, take the Blue Sky Laboratory as the leader, set up PI (Principal Investigator) teams, establish high-level innovation platforms, reinforce discipline building, guide enterprises, universities, and research institutes to form innovation consortia, target frontier fields, strengthen breakthroughs in core systems, accelerate breakthroughs in core technologies, enhance core innovation capabilities, and provide strong support for the high-quality development of the drone industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, application scenarios should be expanded. Strengthen efforts from both the supply and demand sides; stimulate the industry with the market and expand the market with the industry. Enhance production-marketing linkages, accelerate the cultivation of mature consumption models, vigorously develop “drone +” consumer sectors, actively carry out drone application demonstrations, foster more new economic formats and business models, and enhance the consumer market capacity for drones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, infrastructure should be improved. Accelerate the construction of low-altitude infrastructure, build a flexible and distinctive drone service network, improve the low-altitude airspace management mechanism, and create a smart, interconnected, continuously covered, functional, convenient, and efficient low-altitude service support system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, organizational leadership should be reinforced. Coordinate the “visible hand” and “invisible hand,” enhance organizational levels, strengthen support for industrial development, improve drone industry standards systems, build a more competitive industrial ecosystem, and promote the healthy and high-flying development of the drone industry.

      "Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued the \"Opinions on Studying and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping’s Important Speech, Organizing and Leading Workers Across the Province to ‘Strive to Become Skilled Experts and Great Craftsmen of the Nation’\" and the \"Five-Year Plan for the Cultivation of Jiangsu May 1st Craftsmen Talent Project (Trial),\" focusing on establishing a multi-level cultivation system with craftsman features, including national-level craftsmen, Jiangsu May 1st craftsmen, and municipal-level craftsmen. The plan is comprehensive and precisely targeted. However, during interviews, the reporter also noted that, in contrast to the government’s enthusiasm for promoting craftsmen, some enterprises have been less proactive in craftsman cultivation. What lies at the root of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Forging the “Main Force” for Jiangsu’s High-Quality Development  \n",
      "In recent years, Jiangsu’s technical and skilled workforce has continued to grow, but the proportion of skilled workers—especially highly skilled talent—remains low relative to total employment, particularly in emerging industries where high-skilled talent is in severe shortage. In terms of total volume and structure, skilled workers account for less than 30% of the province’s employed population, with high-skilled talent making up less than 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The purpose of the Federation's ‘Double Striving’ campaign is to select frontline workers with marked potential in five areas—leadership, practical ability, innovation, tackling challenges, and passing on skills—as the target group for cultivation. Through organizational training, exchanges, funding, and project support, we aim to enhance their overall qualities, skill levels, and practical innovation abilities, so that more great craftsmen and high-skilled talents can emerge,” said the head of the Labor and Economic Department of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provincial Federation’s implementation opinions on the \"Double Striving\" campaign and the first five-year plan for craftsman cultivation set clear targets: no fewer than 10,000 new various model worker and craftsman innovation studios are to be established in two years; a special incentive fund will be set up for the Jiangsu May 1st Craftsman Talent; and cultivation stations will be established for the same. With timelines, roadmaps, and task lists, these efforts will provide a robust system guarantee for all levels of trade unions across the province to select and nurture craftsman talent in a planned and focused manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Injecting New Momentum into Craftsman Cultivation  \n",
      "Fostering craftsman talent is a traditional strength of trade unions in Jiangsu, leading to many valuable experiences and practices. One outstanding example is the innovation studio for model workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 12, CCTV’s \"Focus Interview\" highlighted Chen Liang, a national labor model in Wuxi, a Yangtze River Delta Great Craftsman, National Great Craftsman nominee, and national-level skill master. This “Micron Master”—renowned in his field—successfully achieved machining precision of 1 micron, breaking through foreign technological monopolies. Chen Liang represents many industrial workers in Wuxi who have evolved from “worker” to “craftsman.” To date, Wuxi has cultivated 1 national Great Craftsman, 1 national Great Craftsman nominee, 4 Jiangsu Great Craftsmen, 62 Jiangsu Craftsmen, 78 Wuxi Great Craftsmen, and 81 Wuxi Craftsmen. As the “foundation of the craftsman pyramid,” Wuxi’s high-skilled talent now accounts for 40% of its skilled workforce—a provincial leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wuxi has established a craftsman cultivation system that is vertically integrated, hierarchically connected, and combines sectoral and regional approaches,” said Liu Guowei, Head of Labor and Economic Department at the Wuxi Federation of Trade Unions. In 2022, the Wuxi municipal government requested the standing committee of the Municipal People’s Congress to establish “Wuxi Craftsman Day” and formed a selection working group with eight entities, including the municipal trade union and the human resources department. They also issued the \"Wuxi Craftsman Selection and Management Measures (Trial)\" and the \"Wuxi Craftsman Preferential Policy Measures (Trial),\" establishing a five-level craftsman cultivation system for the new era.\n",

      "Yuan Yin, Deputy Chairman of the XCMG Heavy Machinery Co. Trade Union in Xuzhou, has extensive experience in deepening the salary incentive mechanism and encouraging employee development through skill competitions. For example, Huang Shixian, a technical process engineer in the company’s Equipment and Energy Department, won national skill competition championships two years in a row. By participating, not only did Huang improve himself, but in line with the company’s policy, he receives a monthly skills allowance of 2,000 yuan. Under his influence, seven other technical process engineers have emerged in his division.\n",

      "It is not easy to ensure employees feel secure in their roles and can thrive, and many issues remain in craftsman talent development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November last year, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions launched a special \"Model Worker and Craftsman Supporting Enterprises\" campaign. So far, nearly 5,000 model workers and craftsmen have participated in 2,028 activities, resolving 2,778 technical problems for enterprises and helping nearly 40,000 employees improve their skills. However, the Federation also discovered that some enterprises worry that their model workers and craftsmen might reveal technical know-how to competitors by helping other companies. Others fear their technical experts, once honored as craftsmen, will be lured away by higher salaries elsewhere. One company leader admitted that several young and famous tech talents had already “migrated” to teach at universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can we further remove institutional barriers and promote the orderly flow of skilled talents between different systems and positions, so as to make the most of everyone’s abilities? This is an important issue concerning the future of craftsman talent,” said the Labor and Economic Department head. Some highly skilled individuals can work as part-time teachers at vocational and technical colleges, passing on their skills and earning extra income, but they don’t necessarily need to leave their companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Jiang Zhaoyi, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Institute of Financial Research, believes that if talent is the number one resource, resource allocation should be driven by the market. By deepening the reform of salary distribution systems and establishing incentives that reward more work, advanced skills, and innovation, more workers will aspire to become skilled and highly skilled talents. The true value of skilled talent should be fully reflected in their compensation, so they gain both status and tangible benefits.\n",

Why aren’t there fences beside the waterfalls? Is the circulation route design reasonable? How can the scenic area create an immersive experience?\" From November 24th to 28th, the MTA (Master of Tourism Administration) program from the School of Tourism at Sun Yat-sen University visited Xiaoqikong Scenic Area, Yaoshan Ancient Village, and other scenic and rural sites in Libo County for five days of practical field teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event was led by He Mang, Vice Dean of the School of Tourism at Sun Yat-sen University, and brought together over 70 faculty and students from the 2021 MTA cohort and the 2022 and 2023 Rural Revitalization MTA classes. The group conducted in-depth case studies at Daqikong and Xiaoqikong Scenic Areas, Yaoshan Ancient Village, Balan Village, and Shuipu Village in Chaoyang Town, exploring how the tourism industry contributes to rural revitalization in Libo.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is reported that, in order to deepen cooperation between China's eastern and western regions and provide intellectual and talent support for Guangzhou’s targeted assistance to Qiannan, and with the promotion of Chen Zhifan, leader of the Qiannan Working Group of the Guangdong-Guizhou Cooperation Task Force, Sun Yat-sen University and Libo County signed an agreement in September this year to jointly establish a practice teaching base for the MTA program. This marks the first time the tourism school has carried out large-scale field teaching in Libo since the start of their cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Sun Yat-sen University’s MTA program has established five rural revitalization practice teaching bases, bringing practical teaching directly to the frontlines of rural areas. This educational model is a positive attempt at reforming professional degree graduate education at the university. Vice County Mayor of Libo, Lu Xiaoquan, commented that this collaboration is not merely an academic exchange; it will have far-reaching impacts in areas such as ecological protection, cultural heritage, east-west cooperation, and rural revitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practical teaching in case sites conducted by the MTA Rural Revitalization Class combines solid theoretical frameworks with real-world problem-solving experience, giving many students the sense that the MTA courses are both grounded and highly practical. Huang Yan, a 2023 Rural Revitalization MTA student from Heixiazi Island in Heilongjiang and a cultural tourism professional, expressed hopes to absorb successful experiences through these case site teachings and elevate her theoretical knowledge. Another 2023 Rural Revitalization MTA student, Ye Xinyi, who is a mother of two and currently engaged in organizing tourism groups to the Xisha Islands, appreciates the learning schedule—which only requires one to two concentrated sessions per semester and doesn’t take up many weekends—making it easier for working mothers to “recharge” themselves while taking care of their families.\n",

      "BYD has dropped its price by another 10,000 yuan, from 79,800 down to 69,800—truly leaving no way out for the competition. This kind of cost performance is simply breaking the rules; others have nowhere to go. The things BYD is able to produce itself give it a cost advantage. The things it procures are also bought at the most favorable prices. Even German Bosch offers BYD the lowest prices—they're treated as a top-tier customer. Other domestic companies don’t get this kind of treatment. BYD has reasons to be confident, and it’s not just about having funds—crucially, BYD has technology in its hands. Technology can be traded for capital, and technology can be exchanged for other technologies. If you don't have the technology, prices will be set by others; but if you do, and everyone needs it, then you can negotiate. For example, BYD uses its in-house ESP (Electronic Stability Program) when bargaining with Bosch, essentially saying: if you don’t give me the best price, I’ll just make it myself, and if my production capacity rises, I might even sell it to other car companies. That's how companies with technology should carry themselves—with this kind of confidence and boldness. It’s like the King of Qin sweeping across the six kingdoms; as for which “six kingdoms,” you can imagine for yourself.\n",

      "Yun Kui is a post-80s forest and grassland fire prevention and extinguishing commander at the Baotou Forestry and Grassland Bureau. He has long been on the front lines of forest and grassland fire prevention and firefighting, living with the forest and making the mountains his home. Whether in the bitter cold of winter or the sweltering summer heat, one can always see his hard-working figure patrolling the deep valleys and mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his fire prevention work, Yun Kui continually updates his professional knowledge and proactively studies the development patterns of forest and grassland fire prevention and extinguishing. Accurate and proactive measures are crucial, so he frequently ventures deep into key forest and grassland areas, attempting to identify all types of fire hazards. His colleagues often say: “Yun Kui is a ‘living map’. For any remote mountain ravine that can’t be found on the real map, just ask him—he’ll know!” His solid professional skills have laid a firm foundation for his fire prevention and firefighting efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baotou is an arid and semi-arid area where fire source control is extremely challenging. To tackle difficulties in fire prevention, Yun Kui set his sights on optimizing management and creatively proposed the “four-wheel drive” grid management mechanism. Under his leadership, Baotou has achieved zero fire incidents during critical periods for consecutive years. In 2022, faced with the highest fire danger level in Baotou’s history, Yun Kui organized more than 60 publicity events, traveled more than 20,000 kilometers, inspected over 5,000 hazard sites and 78,000 scattered graves, achieving the goals of “no fire sources entering the forest, no sacrificial activities in the mountains, and no hazards in key areas”.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more than 160 main fire-prevention valleys in Baotou, and Yun Kui is as familiar with every location as with the back of his hand. Whenever there’s a difficulty in fire prevention or extinguishing across the city’s 10 banners and districts, everyone’s first thought is to “find Yun Kui”. To better serve grassroots communities, Yun Kui insists on visiting every banner and district at least once a month, communicating directly with fire prevention teams and local officials. To respond swiftly to fire emergencies, he has never switched off his phone in over a decade of work; whenever a fire alarm comes in late at night, he always rushes to the scene immediately. At night, wind conditions are usually strong and most fire locations are inaccessible by vehicle, so hiking over mountains and staying up all night have become routine for Yun Kui. He always says, “If I’m not there, my heart will still fly to the fire scene.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Family and friends often ask Yun Kui, “Why do you work so hard, facing danger at any time?” Yun Kui always answers without hesitation, “For the faith of a forestry and grassland worker, for greener mountains and cleaner water in Baotou, and to leave a beautiful green homeland for ourselves and future generations.”\n",

      "To comprehensively promote rural revitalization, it is essential to value the role of talent, open up channels for recruiting capable individuals, bring in talent from across the country, and attract outstanding people. Efforts should be intensified to publicize the achievements of new rural and pastoral area construction, changing the public’s stereotypical impression of these areas as impoverished and backward. Innovative talent introduction methods should be adopted, using hometown feelings and nostalgia as a bond, with a focus on groups such as college students, migrant workers, and retired soldiers, to attract more people to modern agriculture and animal husbandry. The aim is to cultivate a new generation of “new farmers” and “new herders” who are passionate about agriculture and animal husbandry, care about rural and pastoral areas, have broad horizons, and advanced concepts. With a discerning eye for talent and genuine appreciation, talents who meet the needs of key areas, critical links, and important positions—those with the right moral character, abilities, and entrepreneurial spirit—should be selected to provide a source of vitality for rural revitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on the needs of characteristic and advantageous industries, local talents should be managed by classification and targeted cultivation. Through practical technical lectures, mentorship programs, customized training, and other classified training methods, a group of “local experts” and “field scholars” should be developed. Outstanding urban talents can be introduced and utilized resourcefully by organizing “talent service teams” through volunteer services, teaching, and training, choosing professionals from fields like agriculture, education, healthcare, and technology to provide skills and technical services at the grassroots level in rural and pastoral areas. Special attention should be given to supporting and cultivating a group of agricultural and animal husbandry managers, brokers, rural craftsmen, cultural figures, and intangible cultural heritage inheritors. With the intent to nurture capable individuals and solid talent development strategies, efforts should focus on cultivating talent for rural revitalization, enhancing capabilities, and fostering strong character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmlands are the “training ground” for all kinds of talent, and the vast countryside is filled with countless moldable individuals. The mechanism for discovering talent should be constantly refined, making talent team building a foundational project and driving force for rural revitalization. Platforms should be actively established for different talents at the grassroots level based on their expertise and interests, ensuring that the most needed personnel support local development and that talent finds a suitable stage. The work of rural talent scattered across various departments and industries should be coordinated, and the organizational leadership, overall coordination, responsibility, and joint advancement mechanisms should be further improved to more vigorously promote the revitalization of rural talents. Efficiently using and fully leveraging talent, maximizing their strengths in advancing rural revitalization, and compensating for their weaknesses will promote coordinated development of both rural revitalization and talent team growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, grassroots areas have faced the awkward situation of “easy to attract talent but hard to retain them.” As the saying goes, “Plant a parasol tree and the phoenix will come.” In the process of rural talent revitalization, policies, support, honors, and trust should be provided, serving with dedication and emotion to invigorate the talent pool. Enhancing incentives such as career advancement and salary benefits will ensure that talent in rural and pastoral areas are rewarded for their efforts and have no worries about settling down, allowing them to focus on rural development. The key to retaining talent lies in capturing their hearts—creating a work environment and atmosphere that recognizes, values, respects, and utilizes talent, with humanized management that encourages innovation and tolerates failure. This unleashes their full potential and enables them to maximize their value, inspiring them to fully use their abilities, showcase their talents, and make outstanding contributions in the vast rural and pastoral lands.\n",

Nearly 60 participants attended the meeting, including leaders of China Nonferrous, heads of various departments at headquarters, and key party and administrative leaders from subsidiary enterprises.\n",

      "China Nonferrous attached great importance to this conference. As early as August this year, the company's joint party-government meeting made arrangements for the seminar, deciding that after the conclusion of the 17th National Congress, the group would hold a \"Development Seminar\" to guide practice in reform and development with the congress spirit. Comrade Zou Qiao, Party Secretary of China Nonferrous, emphasized that this seminar must be organized well and produce real results; all units should reflect on their actual situations, think carefully, and propose ideas and suggestions. This meeting not only furthered the study of the 17th Congress spirit by the central group of the Party committee but also served as a training session for party affairs cadres at all levels. Through this seminar, learning and implementation of the 17th Congress spirit were further promoted, aiming to unify the thoughts of all party members and staff under its guidance.\n",

      "According to the requirements of the SASAC Party Committee, Luo Tao, General Manager and Deputy Party Secretary of China Nonferrous, conveyed the spirit of the report delivered by Hu Jintao on behalf of the 16th CPC Central Committee, the speech by Zeng Qinghong at the second meeting of the Presidium, and the address by Hu Jintao at the First Plenary Session of the 17th CPC Central Committee. General Manager Luo Tao remarked that the just-concluded 17th National Congress was a milestone event as the Party and country are at a crucial stage of reform and development, and earnest study, publicity, and implementation of its spirit is the primary political task for the present and the period ahead. He called on all Party organizations and members at China Nonferrous to integrate the spirit of the 17th Congress into their enterprise realities, to study and comprehend it thoroughly, and to apply it to their work. Luo Tao stressed the need for a pragmatic approach to learning and implementing the Congress spirit, in accordance with General Secretary Hu Jintao's instruction to “do more foundational and long-term beneficial work,” focusing not only on solving pressing current problems but also on long-term development. Above all, it was necessary to deeply understand the scientific connotations and essence of the Scientific Outlook on Development, to research and address critical obstacles to the sustainable and long-term development of China Nonferrous, and to rapidly translate the Congress spirit into tangible results in carrying out the Scientific Outlook on Development. Under its guidance, the group must adhere to and further enrich the \"12345\" development strategy so as to propel reform and growth.\n",

      "Other leaders, departmental heads, and enterprise officials gathered to earnestly review the work of the first three quarters, analyze the company’s circumstances, opportunities, and challenges in light of the new Congress spirit, and propose ideas and solutions from various perspectives. Collective brainstorming and idea exchange sparked new insights and inspiration throughout the meeting.\n",

      "Guided by the 17th Congress spirit, China Nonferrous is earnestly reflecting on and planning for its future, re-examining its \"12345\" development strategy in accordance with the requirements of the Scientific Outlook on Development. This seminar has elevated the understanding of middle-management cadres, made their thinking more forward-looking, measures more meticulous, and brought about new consensus in thought. It will undoubtedly become a new starting point for China Nonferrous to study, disseminate, and implement the spirit of the 17th Congress, a new starting point for achieving sound and rapid development, for fully building a harmonious enterprise, for strengthening party building, and for advancing comprehension of development theory and practices among the staff, laying a solid foundation for the leapfrog development of the Group.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Notice pointed out that during the evaluation of the case files, all regions attached great importance, carefully organized self-inspection and self-evaluation of fishery administration case files within their jurisdiction, and submitted 175 case files for evaluation. The submission was generally good, and the overall quality of the case files was better than in previous years. The types of case files submitted were diverse, covering cases such as illegal fishing, selling prohibited fishing gear and illegal catches, carrying prohibited fishing gear in violation, violating fishery production safety regulations, producing and selling aquatic products that do not meet agricultural product quality and safety standards, stealing and catching others’ farmed aquatic products, illegal production of aquatic fry, illegal hunting, breeding, and sale of aquatic wild animals, and illegal release of alien species into open waters. After preliminary evaluation and centralized review organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, a total of 116 outstanding case files with a comprehensive score of 90 points or above were selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Notice emphasized that the preparation of fishery administration law enforcement case files is a key link in law enforcement work, reflecting the case-handling approach and law enforcement process of institutions and personnel. All regions should take the evaluation of case files as an opportunity to strengthen leadership and organization, learn from and make reference to outstanding case files, make rectifications based on existing problems, further standardize law enforcement procedures, and improve the quality of case handling. Regular self-inspection and self-evaluation of law enforcement case files should be conducted, with increased professional drills and training. Effective approaches such as case-based teaching and simulated case handling should be adopted, closely integrating the study of laws and regulations with the improvement of case handling skills, so as to genuinely enhance fishery administration law enforcement capabilities and case file preparation standards, and solidly promote high-quality development and modernization of fisheries.\n",

      "This small book was written at the invitation of my friend Zhang Qiulin. It is the first biography I ever wrote, back in 1994. At the time, I titled it \"A Unique Figure Through the Ages: Su Dongpo,\" because in my view, Su Dongpo was truly unparalleled—there was no one like him before or after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back then, there were no computers, so writing meant filling out grid paper by hand. I am very grateful to the leaders of the History Department at Jiangxi Normal University at the time, who gave each teacher ten notebooks of grid paper (with 300 characters per page) every year. I particularly liked this kind of paper, which had large margins on all sides making it easy to revise. Some of my papers back then were \"crawled\" out on this grid paper as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the grid paper with 300 characters per page was my \"assigned field\" at the time; naturally, this \"A Unique Figure Through the Ages: Su Dongpo\" was “cultivated” in that very plot. The method was simple: the ten notebooks of grid paper were placed on the left side of my desk, the main reference books were lined up in front, I read or taught during the day and wrote at night. On average, I filled six or seven pages per day—one notebook per week. In a little over two months, I finished all ten notebooks (50 pages in each), and the book was completed. Then I spent about a week revising the manuscript on the grid paper, submitting the work three months ahead of the scheduled six-month deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995, the Earth Village Bookstore in Taipei published the traditional Chinese edition. Although it was the first time I earned a little US dollar income, the publisher changed the title to \"The Unofficial Biography of Su Dongpo,\" which displeased me. Clearly, it was an “official biography,” but they changed it to \"unofficial\" just to attract attention. To make up for my disappointment, my friend Qiulin, who managed 21st Century Publishing House, published the simplified Chinese edition in 1997 under the original title, \"A Unique Figure Through the Ages: Su Dongpo,\" allowing me to earn a bit of RMB. After the copyright expired, with my consent, China Social Sciences Press republished the simplified edition in 2009, but the cover design was quite baffling. A friend even commented on Douban Reading: \"This book should be included in the ‘Covers That Ruin Good Books’ series.\" Through Douban, I also discovered that a publishing company called Xinchaoshe Cultural Enterprise Co., Ltd. had published the book in 2007 under the title \"The Unofficial Biography of Su Dongpo\" (with no accompanying image), and I have no idea what that was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m grateful to Guangxi Normal University Press for their grand vision in signing publication contracts for five of my books at once, including this \"A Unique Figure Through the Ages: Su Dongpo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After receiving the proofs of \"Su Dongpo\" from the publisher, I spent a few days reading through the manuscript, correcting some typos and inappropriate punctuation, as well as fixing minor historical errors. It should be smoother than previous versions. After reading it, I quite admired my younger self—my skills thirty years ago weren’t bad at all! I even improvised a little poem that sums up Su Dongpo’s life and serves as the chapter titles:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A prodigy from Meishan born,\n",
      "His fame in letters shakes the court.\n",
      "His career off to rocky starts,\n",
      "Su Gong, renowned throughout the realm.\n",
      "Free and easy by rivers and lakes,\n",
      "At court, each day a heavy grind.\n",
      "Once more to the South he’s sent,\n",
      "Why does his homecoming take so long?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there are some paragraphs in this book that I’m not entirely satisfied with. Suddenly, I remember an advertising slogan from years ago: \"When you’re young, there’s nothing you can’t do.\" Looking back now, those really were energetic, confident years; with such boldness, I wrote the whole book in just over two months. But on second thought, if I hadn’t been so bold—so carefree—back then, how could I have finished it in one go? And if the author can’t finish it in one go, how could the reader read it in one?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, in those years, I was able to keep writing day after day—and keep that momentum—thanks to many people. First and foremost, I have to thank my wife, who, after her own work, quietly took care of almost all the housework. My only role was to shop for groceries, bargaining with vendors every couple of days at the market. I also thank my son, who, from grade school through high school, needed very little help from me in his studies. In retrospect, I feel I owe him. I must also thank the leaders at Jiangxi Normal University and the relevant authorities. Before I was appointed as a provincial CPPCC member and head of the university library in 1998, they hadn’t given me any administrative or other duties. Even after I became the library director and dean of a college, the party secretary Xiong Dacheng told me, “You can still teach and research as you always have; you don’t need to punch in, and there are no administrative requirements for you as a cadre.” President Li Xianyu, in reiterating this, told me something I’ve never forgotten: “If you let your scholarship slip because you’re a director or dean, it’s not just your personal loss, but a loss to Jiangxi Normal University.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was director of the Jiangxi Normal University Library, the responsible school leader, my friend Fu Xiuyan, came to the library five times but never saw me—not because I was absent, but because I was either in the stacks or at home. Instead of criticizing me, he praised me: “If you can manage the library from the stacks or your home, that’s true ability. Who says scholars can’t be administrators?” This reminded me of Su Dongpo, Bai Juyi, Lu Jiuyuan, Wang Yangming, and many other famous scholars and cultural figures—they all benefited the places they went. But at the same time, I also feel a bit melancholy: weren’t many corrupt officials, debauched emperors, and doomed monarchs in history also men of vast learning?\n",

      "Flip Camera Smartphones  \n",
      "Because most mobile phones have much better rear cameras than front ones, yet users have a strong demand for taking selfies with the front camera. So, how can a larger sensor be implemented in the front camera without increasing costs, given the limited space inside a phone?  \n",
      "In September 2013, OPPO released the OPPO N1, a smartphone equipped with a camera module capable of rotating freely by 206 degrees. This phone had only a single 13MP rear camera, but by rotating the camera module, users could use the rear camera for selfies. As a result, this phone became highly popular with female consumers at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phone with the Most Cameras  \n",
      "The Nokia 9 PureView features five cameras, plus an evenly arranged flash and distance sensor, which visually led many to mistakenly think it had seven cameras in total. All its cameras are of the same specification. Unlike other multi-camera phones, each of its cameras is equipped with a 12MP sensor and f/1.8 lens, with only two being color sensors and the remaining three monochrome. When taking photos, the five cameras simultaneously capture images with different exposures, combining them into one high-quality photo. This system was co-developed by Nokia and Light, the maker of the Light L16 camera, using Light’s Lux capacitor camera control chip to manage the five cameras. Theoretically, this should result in photos with greater detail and color, but in practice, users experience slow image processing and sometimes even need to use computer software to fully render the images, creating some awkward scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop-up Camera Smartphones  \n",
      "At one point, the mobile phone industry was fiercely debating whether to use a punch-hole display or a true full-screen display. At this time, OPPO offered an entirely new solution: the pop-up camera module.  \n",
      "Released in June 2018, the OPPO Find X is a full-screen phone where both the front and rear cameras are designed as a single module, which mechanically slides up and down. When the camera is not in use, the module is fully hidden inside the body, making the Find X a “true full-screen” phone with ultra-narrow bezels and no punch-holes. When retracted, the back of the Find X is a seamless piece of glass, smooth and elegant. This minimalist and bold design was a significant innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Point-and-Shoot Camera Smartphone  \n",
      "In 2013, Samsung took an unprecedented step by launching a smartphone that looked like a point-and-shoot camera from the back but appeared like any other phone from the front: the Galaxy S4 Zoom. Based on the Galaxy S4 mini, it introduced a feature that surpassed all other smartphones at the time: a 10x (24-240mm) optical zoom lens with optical image stabilization and a 1/2.33-inch 16MP BSI CMOS sensor. The 10x optical zoom lens extended automatically during shooting, providing the satisfaction of holding a dedicated camera.  \n",
      "Although the Galaxy S4 Zoom was seemingly a reasonable and creative product, limitations with the Android OS and phone hardware at the time meant phones could not yet replace traditional cameras. Samsung later discontinued such products, which is somewhat regrettable.\n",

It boasted a cutting-edge glasses-free 3D holographic screen, a large battery, a unique wavy frame, a modular extension connector for professional camera accessories, and a stylish rear case design. The design followed RED’s signature style: bulky yet solid. However, the glasses-free 3D screen, the phone’s main selling point, was heavily criticized for its lack of usable scenarios and content.  \n",
      "After the lukewarm market response, RED abandoned its smartphone plans and returned its focus to high-end imaging equipment.\n",

      "Mobile phone screens are inevitably small. How can the display be enlarged for a better experience and easier content sharing? Samsung’s Galaxy Beam, released in 2012, introduced an entirely new idea by including a built-in projector. Running Android 2.3, the phone’s top-mounted projector could cast phone content up to 50 inches in size at 15 lumens brightness.  \n",
      "In 2012, such a portable mini-projector was enticing, but the size of the projection module made the phone 12.5mm thick, and the 15-lumen brightness was insufficient for daylight use, working only in very dark environments. These issues limited practicality, eventually leading to its market demise.\n",

      "E-ink Screen Smartphone  \n",
      "The YOTA dual-screen phone featured both a regular color display on the front and an e-ink screen (like those used in e-readers) on the back, making it the world’s first dual-screen and e-ink screen smartphone. The YOTA phone originated in Russia and was later co-developed with Chinese firms, producing the YOTA3 dual-screen model.  \n",
      "The primary idea was to extend battery life, using the low-power e-ink side for reading news, emails, and webpages, while reserving the color screen for video or image viewing.  \n",
      "However, the design was controversial from the first generation. Coupled with non-flagship-level specs, the YOTA phone became a niche product and failed to gain a foothold in China’s competitive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dual-Screen Smartphone  \n",
      "LG has made multiple attempts at multi-screen phones, once launching the LG V50 ThinQ, which could externally attach another display, creating a foldable-phone-like twin-screen experience. This appealed to some gamers, as game graphics and controls could be split between screens.  \n",
      "Later, LG introduced the LG Wing with two built-in displays, one rotatable by 90 degrees, inspired by the swivel slider phones of the feature phone era. This allowed users to utilize different functions on the two displays, e.g., using the landscape screen for viewfinding and the portrait screen for camera settings. However, due to poor app adaptation, many apps malfunctioned or couldn’t be used normally, which was a key reason for its market exit.\n",

Yet BlackBerry, heavily outcompeted by iPhone and Android, continued releasing smartphones with built-in keyboards.  \n",
      "The BlackBerry Passport stood out for its rare square screen and full QWERTY keyboard, making it look quite clunky. Released in 2015, it struggled for relevance in the touchscreen era, with little consumer interest in physical keyboards. Thus it became the last device to run BlackBerry’s in-house OS; afterwards, BlackBerry switched to Android for its operating system.\n",

      "\n",
      "Li Qiang stated that the China International Supply Chain Expo is the world’s first national-level expo themed on supply chains. The current global economic recovery is facing difficulties. As President Xi Jinping has pointed out, maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for promoting world economic development. Consolidating and strengthening global industrial and supply chain cooperation is in the common interest of all parties and is an urgent expectation. The purpose of China hosting this expo is to respond to the call of the times and create an international platform for all parties to strengthen communication, deepen cooperation, and pursue common development.\n",

      "\n",
      "Li Qiang pointed out that both history and reality have proven that all countries generally benefit when cooperation in global industrial and supply chains remains stable and continues to deepen; conversely, all countries suffer when such cooperation is obstructed or stagnates. China is not only a participant and beneficiary of this cooperation but also a resolute defender and builder. China is willing to work together with all parties to make global industrial and supply chains more resilient, more efficient, and more dynamic, making greater contributions to world economic recovery and global development and prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Qiang put forward four proposals for deepening international cooperation in industrial and supply chains: \n",
      "1. Jointly building safe and stable industrial and supply chains. Strengthening resource coordination of key industrial chains on a global scale and not arbitrarily interfering with market activities. China will continue to provide the world with high-quality Chinese manufacturing and a stable supply from China.\n",
      "2. Jointly building smooth and efficient industrial and supply chains. Further enhancing global connectivity to enable easier circulation and more effective allocation of production factors. China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and enhance innovative cooperation in fields such as intelligent manufacturing and the digital economy.\n",
      "3. Jointly building open and inclusive industrial and supply chains. China stands firmly against protectionism and all forms of “decoupling and breaking of supply chains,” and will also work hard to promote a green and low-carbon transformation of supply chains. China will further integrate into the global industrial and supply chain system and actively participate in international cooperation in the field of green development.\n",
      "4. Jointly building mutually beneficial and win-win industrial and supply chains. Promote the establishment of a global industrial and supply chain system that is broadly participatory, complementary in advantages, and shares benefits. China will actively promote industrial and capacity cooperation with all countries and help developing countries participate more deeply in the global value chain. We hope entrepreneurs from all countries will play an active role in maintaining the stable operation of global industrial and supply chains. China will provide more convenience and better guarantees for foreign companies investing and developing business in China.\n",

      "Host’s Remarks\n",
      "The Sixth Plenary Session of the 17th CPC Central Committee proposed accelerating the development of the cultural industry and promoting it as a pillar of the national economy. For Jiujiang, tourism is the signature of its “cultural dominance.” As a city with abundant, profound, and long-standing historical and cultural resources, relying solely on existing resources is easy; but to make its tourism brand truly distinctive and innovative is by no means an easy task—yet Jiujiang has achieved this. How has Jiujiang managed to closely integrate culture and tourism to unleash the potential, vitality, and capability of its cultural tourism industry? In this issue of “Hundred Cities for Cultural Empowerment,” we enter Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, to explore the answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Program Host: Yang Liang\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a city blessed with exceptional natural resources: the mighty Yangtze River, the extensive Gan River, and the vast Poyang Lake all converge here, while the majestic Lushan Mountain stands tall and proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also a city steeped in rich humanistic history: home to cultural giants like Tao Yuanming and Huang Tingjian, and a place where more than 2,000 famous figures, including Li Bai, Bai Juyi, Zhu Xi, and others, have left their eternal marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jiujiang, the famous historical and cultural city in northern Jiangxi, is inheriting the past and opening up the future, writing a vibrant and colorful new chapter in cultural tourism development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a City with Soul\n",
      "Not long ago, the brand-new Jiujiang Art Museum was completed in the Cui Bamboo Court of Nanhu Park—the largest bamboo architectural garden in southern China. This art museum, with an investment of nearly 20 million yuan, a garden area of more than 10,000 square meters, and a construction area of over 3,000 square meters, has made Hu Yixin, Executive Vice President of the Jiujiang Academy of Painting and Calligraphy, ecstatic: “Jiujiang has long been hailed as ‘half the world of Jiangxi’s painting and calligraphy scene’; the new art museum has provided Jiujiang with an excellent ‘cultural window.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the construction of the Jiujiang Art Museum is just the tip of the iceberg in the panorama of cultural facility development in Jiujiang. According to Ke Henglong, Director of the Jiujiang Municipal Bureau of Culture, News, and Publications, in recent years Jiujiang has increased investment in cultural infrastructure, putting over 1 billion yuan into the construction and renovation of museums, cultural and arts centers, art academies, and riverside ecological cultural parks—more than the total investment made in cultural infrastructure over the past decade. This has laid a solid material foundation for the development and take-off of Jiujiang’s culture. “For us in the cultural system, this is a tremendous event. The number of projects and the scale of investment are unprecedented!” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking in Jiujiang: In the old city area of Xunyang, the restoration and renovation of a number of ancient buildings, such as the Riverside Cultural Ecological Park, the west section of Zhong Road, and the historical district of Yuliang South Road, have painted a beautiful cultural landscape; on the banks of the new district’s Bali Lake, public cultural and sports facilities like the Cultural Art Center, the Sports Center, and the Museum have risen up impressively; in Lushan, the Mao Zedong Poetry Garden and the Five Religions Prayer Cultural Park are nestled among picturesque mountains and rivers, offering unique cultural charm. Cai Mengmeng, a lifelong resident of Jiujiang, describes her feelings as “one pleasant surprise after another—the city is becoming more beautiful and more culturally vibrant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Culture is the soul of the city,” says Zhong Ligui, Vice Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and Secretary of the Jiujiang Municipal Party Committee. “At present, Jiujiang is at a stage of rapid industrialization and urbanization, but in our guiding ideology, work advancement, and project investment, we have never relaxed our efforts or reduced our commitment to cultural development. Jiujiang’s natural resources will be integrated into city building, and cultural and tourism resources will be effectively combined. Resource integration will create synergy and competitiveness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Let Culture’s Potential Be Fully Released\n",
      "In recent years, the number of tourists coming to Jiujiang has been growing. Their travel routes are described by Jiujiang’s tourism staff as “Touring Jiujiang through Textbooks”—of the 180-plus classic ancient poems, essays, and stories included in the People’s Educational Press Chinese textbooks for primary and secondary schools, nine are set in Jiujiang—about one in twenty. These include Li Bai’s “Viewing the Waterfall at Lushan Mountain,” Su Shi’s “Writing on Xilin Wall” and “Records of Shizhong Mountain,” Bai Juyi’s “The Song of the Pipa Player” and “Peach Blossoms at Dalin Temple,” Tao Yuanming’s “The Peach Blossom Spring,” “Drinking Wine,” and “Returning to Country Life,” as well as Zhou Dunyi’s “Ode to the Lotus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tourism and culture are closely linked—culture is the sail, tourism is the ship; the stronger the cultural sail, the faster the tourism ship can go,” said Du Shaohua, Director of the Jiujiang Tourism Bureau. “Our rich historical and cultural heritage and the vibrant development of our cultural industry have created unique conditions for upgrading Jiujiang’s tourism sector. The rapid growth of Jiujiang’s tourism in recent years is clear proof of this.” Jiujiang has proposed to fully tap its profound cultural heritage and rich ecological tourism resources, develop itself into a tourism and leisure hub in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and become a nationally and even globally renowned cultural tourism destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The diversity of Jiujiang’s culture gives its tourism greater depth. We must deeply uncover the cultural significance of famous local figures, protect and pass down historical and cultural heritage, and raise the quality of Jiujiang’s tourism,” said Mayor Yin Meigen. He introduced that at present, Jiujiang is following the principles of “preservation, excavation, integration, and construction” to develop its cultural tourism projects, ensuring the preservation of heritage, the restoration of the old to its original state, and the building of new imitating the old. In developing modern cultural tourism projects, the focus is on forging boutique cultural tourism routes and integrating resources to connect the mountains and the city, establishing the comprehensive “Greater Lushan” tourism framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Jiujiang’s urban development map, projects such as China CITIC Lushan West Sea International Eco-Tourism Area, Bailudong Cultural Park, Dreamlike Lushan, the Bronze Culture Theme Park, and “The World of Da Qian” cultural entertainment have all been highlighted, signaling a new leap forward for Jiujiang’s cultural tourism industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Culture and the economy interact,” said Zhong Ligui, Vice Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Secretary of the Jiujiang Municipal Party Committee. “Culture can promote economic development, and economic growth and urbanization will inevitably and positively impact the development of cultural tourism.”\n",

Reporters learned that, coordinated by customs and other departments, fresh cherries can reach wholesale markets as quickly as two hours after being offloaded. Cui Yanwei, Business Director of Guangzhou Nansha International Cold Chain Co., Ltd., stated that the Nansha International Logistics Center in the port area has completed three large portside cold storage facilities with a total capacity of about 230,000 tons. These are officially designated and bonded warehouses for imported meat, fruit, and other goods. \"This season, 12 vessels carrying cherries will arrive in the domestic market before the Spring Festival, accounting for one-third of China's total cherry imports.\"\n",

There, they studied the call from the CPC Central Committee to strengthen the culture of integrity in the new era and to promote a culture of investigation and research throughout the Party. Against the backdrop of pure white pear blossoms, all Party members solemnly revisited the oath of joining the Party in front of the Party flag. In the midst of the elegant and pristine flowers, the Party members and cadres reflected on the pure and noble character symbolized by pear blossoms and conducted in-depth research on the production and operation of the Haicheng Nanguo pear. Afterwards, all Party members and cadres went together to the Haicheng City Clean Government Plaza, where they studied anti-corruption messages, exposure platforms, and snapshots of integrity in the “Qingfeng Garden” anti-corruption corridor.

      "From the book-building situation, institutional investors showed high enthusiasm for participating in this public REIT. A total of 252 subscription quotes were received from 83 offline institutional investors, including major institutional investors such as insurance companies, securities companies (both proprietary trading and asset management), private equity funds, and trusts. The total intended subscription amount from all allocation objects reached 186.241 million units, equivalent to 133.03 times the initial offline offering amount. The quotation range was between RMB 2.270/unit and RMB 2.610/unit, with the median offline investor quotation at RMB 2.610/unit and the weighted average at RMB 2.600/unit. Based on the median, the weighted average, as well as market conditions and issuance risks, the fund manager and financial advisor determined the final offering price to be RMB 2.484/unit.\n",

      "The offline book-building subscription multiplier for Red Earth Shenzhen Anju REIT reached 133 times, significantly exceeding those of previously issued infrastructure REITs, reflecting institutional investors' strong support for the affordable rental housing sector and recognition of this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying assets of the Red Earth Shenzhen Anju REIT consist of affordable rental housing projects located in the core areas of Shenzhen, a major city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Specifically, the assets include the Baiquange Project in Futian District, the Jinyuan Project in Luohu District, the Poly Champagne Garden Project in Dapeng New District, and the Phoenix Mansion Project in Pingshan District. These projects offer strong housing security, complete surrounding facilities, and high residential quality. The total construction area of these base assets is 134,700 square meters, encompassing 1,830 affordable rental housing units with an appraised value of approximately RMB 1.158 billion. As of the end of March 2022, the occupancy rates of all four projects exceeded 98%, with three-year lease contracts accounting for 98% and renewal mechanisms in place. Rental prices are about 60% of the market rate for rental housing of similar location and quality. The sponsor and main original equity holder, Shenzhen Talent Anju Group, is a specialized institution in charge of investment, construction, and operational management of public housing in Shenzhen. The approval and issuance of the Red Earth Shenzhen Anju REIT serves as a positive example in promoting the market-oriented and professional transformation of affordable rental housing service models.\n",

Based on the procuratorial recommendations, we have conducted targeted clean-up actions against drug-related crimes in delivery channels and required front-line staff to sign anti-drug responsibility letters, which has achieved significant results.” On February 8, during a follow-up visit regarding the implementation of the recommendations, a manager of an express delivery company told a prosecutor from the Mountain District Procuratorate in Hebi City, Henan Province.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address delivery safety issues, on December 8, 2022, the Mountain District Procuratorate, in connection with Zhang’s drug-related case and similar cases, issued procuratorial recommendations to logistics companies involved in the case, requiring the companies to increase investment in goods inspection and security equipment, equip themselves with highly intelligent, portable security devices, publicly display a guide to prohibited items in business premises, post or play anti-drug publicity materials, and enhance the ability of delivery staff to identify drugs and strengthen their legal and safety awareness and sense of responsibility.\n",

      "While handling Wu’s drug smuggling and trafficking case, the prosecutor from the Mountain District Procuratorate discovered through Wu’s phone data and Alipay transaction records that a person with the WeChat nickname “Mr. Fan” was Wu’s supplier. The prosecutor then issued an opinion to the police to arrest the suspect. Police investigation found “Mr. Fan” was Zhang, who worked in a hospital in Shanxi Province.\n",
      " \n",
      "After graduating from university in 2015, Zhang joined the hospital, assisting anesthesiologists with surgical anesthesia.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Zhang was not content with his stable job. The monthly 5,000 yuan mortgage, the need to care for his young child, and daily family expenses left him under great pressure. He decided to exploit management loopholes in the hospital’s handling of sevoflurane (an inhalation anesthetic) to make some “extra money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to regulations, only anesthesiologists can access sevoflurane. Due to a shortage of anesthesiologists, Zhang, who lacked the requisite certification, acted as an anesthesiologist. He was thoroughly familiar with procedures for accessing sevoflurane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sevoflurane is usually added by the bottle to a vaporizer; the amount prescribed by doctors for patients is always an estimate, so over time there is surplus — unopened bottles are left unused and are periodically “cleared out.” Zhang inflated the amount of anesthetics recorded for surgeries and, seizing moments when colleagues were distracted, privately removed entire bottles of unused, patient-paid sevoflurane from the operating room. From July 2018 to September 2021, Zhang took out 229 bottles of sevoflurane; using the same method, he also took 249 ampoules of midazolam injection, sneaking them home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until September 24, 2021, when the police came to the hospital to arrest Zhang, that the supposedly “disposed” drugs reappeared in his locker – these were drugs he had not yet managed to sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selling Online for Huge Profits\n",
      "\n",
      "With the drugs on hand, Zhang began looking for buyers. He searched online forums related to sevoflurane to find customers, gradually entering the circle of pharmaceutical trafficking. He made substantial “extra” income selling these drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, some buyers introduced new customers to him, and his “business” grew. Sometimes he acted as a middleman, helping buyers purchase other controlled psychiatric drugs and taking a commission on the difference. During this time, he sold 144 bottles of sevoflurane and 15 ampoules of midazolam, illegally earning 120,000 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As transactions increased, Zhang tried various ways to collect payment. Initially, he sent buyers his WeChat payment code for direct transfer, but, after a buyer “helpfully” warned him, he switched methods. To cover his tracks, he used Alipay’s “password red packet” feature to receive funds, guiding buyers step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using Others’ IDs to Ship Drugs\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang’s buyers came from all over the country. He shipped the drugs via express courier. To avoid inspection, he removed the labels from the outer packaging, wrapped the sevoflurane bottles in air column bags, and boxed them up before mailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When couriers inquired about the liquid inside, Zhang, knowing the drug bottles were brown, lied and claimed it was “foot soaking solution.” Lacking professional knowledge, the couriers couldn’t verify otherwise. As a regular customer, Zhang became familiar to the couriers, who then dropped their guard. For all shipments, Zhang used other people’s identity cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "After review, the procuratorial authorities determined that triazolam and midazolam are both listed as Class II psychotropic substances in the “Catalogue of Psychotropic Drugs.” According to criminal law, the drugs Zhang sold qualified as narcotics. Sevoflurane, being a prescription medication, was misappropriated by Zhang thanks to his job position, constituting the crime of occupational embezzlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 19, 2022, the Mountain District Procuratorate charged Zhang with drug smuggling and trafficking and occupational embezzlement. On November 28, the court sentenced him to three years in prison and a fine of 10,000 yuan for drug smuggling and trafficking; ten months in prison and a fine of 20,000 yuan for occupational embezzlement; for a total of three years and one month in prison and a combined fine of 30,000 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 12, 2022, prosecutors traveled to Shanxi to deliver the “Procuratorial Recommendations” and had a discussion with hospital administrators. They discussed problems exposed by Zhang’s case, including unreasonable medication management policies, improper disposal of medical waste liquids, and inadequate implementation of protocols for counting controlled drugs during anesthesiology staff handovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "After receiving the recommendations, the hospital took them seriously and immediately rectified the situation by revising medication management protocols, improving the use process of anesthetics to prevent loopholes during use, strengthening training, clarifying departmental and individual responsibilities, and intensifying supervision at the hospital and departmental levels to guarantee standardized management at all stages, thus preventing loss and leakage of controlled narcotic drugs from the source.\n",

      "\n",
      "Online fraud cases are on the rise. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently revealed that in the first nine months of this year, it received 954 bank-related complaints involving scams, far surpassing last year's total of 555 cases. To prevent such incidents, the HKMA has launched ten new measures to further enhance electronic banking security. These include multi-factor authentication, notifications of abnormal or suspicious account activities, and the ability to quickly suspend access to e-banking accounts. The HKMA has already issued guidelines to banks, requiring all local banks to fully implement these new arrangements by March next year.  \n",
      "—Reported by Ta Kung Pao, Shao Shufen\n",
      "\n",
      "HKMA Assistant Chief Executive (Banking Supervision) Arthur Chan said the Authority has been closely monitoring both international and local fraud trends and regularly shares information on scam tactics and preventative measures with the banking sector. This ensures banks’ risk management approaches stay up to date and customers’ interests are protected. He hopes banks will continue to improve their anti-fraud capabilities and swiftly tighten controls to plug loopholes once any scam occurs. Just as security features on banknotes must be constantly upgraded to counter increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting, so must banks adapt to new fraud technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beware of Malicious Programs Stealing Passwords\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the latest police data, there were 15,000 technology crime cases in the first half of this year, a 47% increase compared to the same period last year. However, fraud cases involving manipulation of local e-banking accounts remain sporadic. Nonetheless, Chan pointed out that the HKMA has noted an increase in similar schemes overseas, such as scammers developing malicious programs targeting Android operating systems. These programs can trick the public into downloading them via links or QR codes. Once installed, they can capture users’ e-banking passwords and read one-time SMS codes without the customer noticing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chan said existing e-banking guidelines already require safeguards against malicious software. For example, before providing e-banking services, banks must check the security status of the customer’s mobile device: whether it is “jailbroken” or shows signs of having malware installed. If the device is deemed insecure, the relevant services should not be offered. Furthermore, if the bank’s mobile app offers critical features such as a mobile security token, it must implement even stricter measures against malware, such as checking whether the screen is being recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-Time Monitoring and Identification of Suspicious Accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "Although existing e-banking guidelines already outline requirements to guard against malicious software, Chan hopes to proactively strengthen local e-banking security before similar scams become prevalent. This will enable banks to more effectively prevent fraudsters from stealing customers' deposits via electronic channels. The latest measures focus on enhanced monitoring of suspicious transactions, stricter identity authentication, and improved customer notifications. Key measures include establishing dynamic fraud monitoring mechanisms that take a customer’s transaction patterns and data more comprehensively into account to quickly identify suspicious account activity. When unusual or high-risk transactions are detected, banks will require customers to complete surprise identity authentication, or add a third authentication step atop two-factor authentication, to confirm the account is not being used by someone else. In addition to high-risk transactions, banks should notify customers of any abnormal activity in their accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there have been cases where customers could not reach the bank in time to suspend credit card services when suspected unauthorized use occurred. The HKMA will require banks to set up dedicated hotlines or allow users to immediately suspend e-banking or credit card accounts via online banking platforms. Furthermore, the same e-banking account must not be simultaneously logged in on more than one device.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked whether additional identity checks (such as surprise authentication) might affect customer convenience or experience, Chan stressed that there must be a balance between account security and user experience. He emphasized that not every transaction will trigger extra authentication; only suspicious or high-risk transactions will require it. He believes this will not significantly affect user experience.\n",

      "The center’s first major relics exhibition, “Encountering the Aegean: Masterpieces from the National Archaeological Museum of Naples,” will open on November 28. According to Beijing Youth Daily, this exhibition will display a total of 123 artifacts (sets) from Ancient Greece, including sculptures, pottery, goldware, bronzeware, etc. All exhibits are from one of Italy’s most important and oldest archaeological museums—the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. Spanning relics from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century CE, the exhibition offers a multidimensional view of ancient Greek society and culture, covering daily life, religious mythology, sports competitions, and more. It also sheds light on the profound impact that Greece’s rich material and spiritual achievements have had on later generations. In addition, exhibitions including a Yuanmingyuan scientific research achievements exhibition, a basic Haidian relics display, and a Sanshan Wuyuan digital exhibition are also in active preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the press conference, Huang Ying reported on the district’s progress in relics protection and tourism development. The Haidian District Bureau of Culture and Tourism, under the framework of a “One Core, One Zone, Two Belts, Multiple Clusters” strategy for building a strong cultural Haidian, has enhanced top-level planning and sought to shape the district as a “Humanistic, Innovative City.” In recent years, Haidian’s cultural and tourism resources have grown richer. The district now boasts 16 A-level tourist attractions, 13 red tourism sites, 3 nationally or municipally recognized tourism and leisure neighborhoods, 1 national consumption cluster, and 2 nationally piloted immersive smart tourism experience projects. There are also 8 national-level intangible cultural heritage representative projects, such as the Liulangzhuang Wuhu Stick Art. According to statistics, in the first three quarters of this year, Haidian ranked first in the city for net visitor numbers, and second for tourism revenue.\n",

      "Moreover, the district’s relic protection and utilization standards have markedly improved. Haidian now has 329 immovable relics, including 22 major national heritage protection sites, 2 World Cultural Heritage sites, and 1 national archaeological site park. Compared to China’s third national relic census (2007–2011), the number of immovable relics increased by 32, with 96 relics being upgraded in status, and 21 revolutionary relics added.\n",

      "“On patrol, Party members lead the way.” This is a fine tradition of the company: every time they go on patrol, Party member backbones take the lead, with new recruits bringing up the rear. Senior Sergeant Tan Minxu, experienced and reliable, always prepares a safety rope before each patrol, tying it securely to the waists of the men behind him, transforming the patrol team into what looks like a “giant dragon.”\n",

      "That year, Tan Minxu went on patrol for the first time. There were bottomless cliffs on both sides. As he climbed a steep slope, the lack of oxygen made him inattentive and he stepped on some loose stones. Luckily, the safety rope fastened to the others saved him from disaster.\n",

      "“In the high mountains and dense forests, there is not only beauty, but also unpredictable danger,” Tan Minxu says with emotion.\n",

Through many acts of perseverance, he grew from a recruit into a veteran border soldier—a “living map.” In Tan Minxu’s notebooks, he records with clarity where there are potholes, trails, and bends along the patrol routes.\n",

      "Long before dawn, the patrol squad of Gyirong Border Defense Company is already up, suited and equipped, ready to set out. Among them is Private Lu Ruizhen. His expression is particularly solemn. For most, today’s patrol is routine, but for him, it is his first—a unique milestone.\n",
      "\n",
      "After graduating from college, Lu Ruizhen chose to enlist in Tibet. His determination to become a border guard stems from his father, who also once served as a border soldier in Tibet. Early this year, Lu Ruizhen’s father sadly passed away, never getting to see his son in uniform; this became his lifelong regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "To experience the patrol routes and border lines his father once guarded, Lu Ruizhen put his father’s national defense service medal in the pocket on his chest for this patrol.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the border, every inch of land beneath our feet is part of the motherland!” Gazing at the towering mountains, Lu recalled his father’s instructions, with memories flooding back…\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning back time to 1988, Lu Ruizhen’s father, Lu Xiaoxun, answered the call to enlist in Tibet’s Shigatse region from Santai in Sichuan. He guarded the long border for a full 20 years. “My father joined the Party within a year of enlisting and was promoted the next year. After graduation, he continued defending the frontier.” These memories inspire Lu Ruizhen to press forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the patrol continued and altitude rose, each step became increasingly difficult, breaths more urgent. For the first time, Lu realized just how arduous mountaineering at high altitude could be. Political instructor Wang Wei cheered him on: “Come on, Lu Ruizhen!” His fellow soldiers encouraged him, too: “Come on, Lu Ruizhen!” Lu shouted back, “If my father could walk this road, so can I—and I’ll do even better! Wearing your service medal, I must not lose face for you!” With that conviction, newfound strength surged into his steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crossing mountain after mountain, Lu finally reached the destination. At the snowy summit, the wind howled and the Five-Star Red Flag fluttered in the breeze. At that moment, Lu Ruizhen profoundly understood what his father’s 20 years of perseverance here meant: for the red flag to fly at the border marker is the highest honor and pride.\n",

      "\n",
      "On April 25, 2015, at midday, Fang and another soldier obtained leave to buy train tickets home. At 2:11 p.m., Nepal was struck by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake. Some houses in Gyirong Town collapsed and civilians were trapped. Originally planning to go home for his son’s “full-month banquet,” Fang Chengpeng voluntarily gave up his leave, choosing instead to carry out his duty and join the company’s rescue efforts.\n",

It is renowned as a “summer paradise” and a “wellness haven.” Thanks to its unique geographical environment, all vegetables grown here are green and pollution-free, with a distinct and unparalleled taste. Although delicacies such as “Concubine’s Free-Range Chicken” and “Sour Water Tofu” are rare treats, my heart remains fondest of the ever-present corn.\n",
      "\n",
      "My hometown lies deep in the mountains. Over twenty years ago, almost every household kept a firepit. At night, the family would gather around, chatting, while corn cobs roasted in the fire, turning a glossy yellow and filling the room with their aroma. Like a gentle song echoing along winding paths, that elusive, winding feeling always fascinated me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only when I saw neighborhood children eating corn cobs did I remember that this was the season for fresh, tender corn. In years past, back home in Zengjia Mountain near Guangyuan, we would add water to a pot and toss in freshly picked tender corn cobs. With hands clapping and feet dancing in anticipation, I could hardly wait to bite into them and let the flavor reach my very core. Once cooked, the fragrance would drift everywhere, perfuming front and backyards, and even the whole village. Taking a big bite, the fresh sweetness burst out fiercely, lingers long, leaving my mouth tasting delightful for days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Times are getting better, and eating whole grains is now a city trend. All because of their nutrition and health benefits, corn has finally become a staple on the table. Some even add corn to fragrant dishes like Kung Pao Chicken—pairing perfectly with peas, each flavor shines on its own. There are various corn-based dishes, such as Mizhengen Rice, Treasure Bowl, and Golden-Wrapped Silver. At home, we make porridge with mizhengen—corn crushed into countless tiny diamond-shaped grains, hence the name “mizhengen.” When craving it, we’d boil a pot of water, add a large bowl when the water boils, and adjust the thickness as needed. After lifting the lid three times, we’d scoop a big bowl, add some hot peppers, and eat until the bowl was squeaky clean, scraping up every last bit. That satisfying feeling could make me happy and energized for the whole day.\n",

      "Corn is a constant presence on city tables, but it is even more treasured in my hometown, appearing in meals throughout the year. It can be boiled, roasted, stir-fried, or stewed; ground into grits or flour. Used in stir-fries, porridges, dumplings, or corn cakes, it awakens the appetite and never grows tiresome.\n",

The tassels, like the hair of children and elders, and the greenish-yellow husks, layered like swaddling clothes, wrap the precious corn babies inside. After harvest, golden corn cobs fill every courtyard in the village. The corn piled on balconies resembles towers of gold, and the braids of corn hanging under the eaves look like strings of pearly beads. Like little Buddhas grinning with joy, they tell their own stories—of good harvests and prosperous years.\n",

Among these institutions, there are fund managers who oversee more than 10 billion RMB.\n",

      "The reporter found that among the institutions increasing holdings of pharmaceutical stocks in Q4 this year, there are fund managers overseeing more than 10 billion RMB. For example, Aier Eye Hospital was further increased by Ge Lan in Q4. As of October 24, China Europe Healthcare Mixed Fund held 263 million shares of Aier Eye Hospital, representing 2.82% of its total share capital. According to financial reports, from 2020 to 2022, Aier Eye Hospital’s operating revenue was 11.912 billion RMB, 15 billion RMB, and 16.11 billion RMB, and its net profit attributable to shareholders was 1.724 billion RMB, 2.323 billion RMB, and 2.524 billion RMB, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a long-term perspective, China Europe Healthcare Mixed Fund has continued to increase its holdings in Aier Eye Hospital. At the end of June 2021, it only held 73.604 million shares, but by the end of 2021, it had increased to 141 million. By mid-2022 and the end of 2022, holdings rose to 161 million and 207 million shares, respectively. By the end of Q3 this year, it held 259 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that Ge Lan currently manages three funds: China Europe Healthcare A/C, China Europe Insight New Starting Point, and China Europe Healthcare Innovation A/C. As of the end of Q3 this year, the managed scale was 51.02 billion RMB, 1.432 billion RMB, and 11.356 billion RMB, respectively.

      "Robust Demand in the Medical Market\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With aging and consumption upgrades, China’s continued growth in consumer medical demand is relatively certain, and a high-quality, diversified, multi-level healthcare system requires private medical participation as a supplement. Medical services in China have long been in short supply. Private medical institutions strongly complement public ones,\" said Zhu Mingrui, manager at Nord Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhu points out that in the past two years, medical institutions have seen performance fluctuations from visitor flow management, medical service price reforms, centralized procurement, and DRG policy rollouts. As a result, the consumer medical sector's valuation has continued to experience corrections. With ongoing domestic economic recovery, consumer healthcare sector performance may gradually be validated, and the impact of associated policies may become clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Zhu believes that the innovative drug sector is undergoing a critical transition from fast imitation to differentiated innovation. From a policy standpoint, innovation remains an eternal theme, with supportive policies from both the reimbursement and the review sides. In medical insurance, the 2022 medical insurance negotiation rules introduced a simple renewal rule for the first time: for exclusive products where the actual fund expenditures during the agreement period did not exceed 200% of the forecast and with reasonable budget increases anticipated, the product can be renewed simply. Prices are adjusted downward based on any overage. Under this new rule, differentiated innovative products may enjoy greater bargaining space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guotai Junan also notes that as approval standards rise and the industry’s learning curve climbs, China’s innovative drug sector is moving from an era of \"quantitative change\" to \"qualitative change.\" Some new drugs show greater clinical benefit potential, while Chinese-developed drugs are being out-licensed and approved overseas one after another. Now, new drug revenue from innovative firms is soaring, R&D and sales expense ratios are improving, profitability is rising, and commercialization is entering an accelerated harvest phase. They recommend prioritizing sub-sector leaders with stable main businesses and breakthroughs in overseas markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its research report, Kaiyuan Securities stated that, looking ahead to 2024 on the supply side of pharmaceuticals and biologics, new blockbuster innovative drugs are emerging and gradually entering commercialization. With commercialization progressing, relevant companies can quickly recoup cash, which may further promote development of their pipelines, entering a virtuous cycle. The innovative drug industry chain is showing clear differentiation—overseas demand is stabilizing, while domestic demand awaits improvement. The firm also sees promising prospects for medical imaging equipment, hemodialysis equipment, and the traditional Chinese medicine sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhu Mingrui also believes that domestic demand for China’s medical device market remains robust, and there is still significant room for improvement in the drug-to-device ratio. For the equipment segment of medical devices, in highly technological fields such as PET-CT and flexible and rigid endoscopes, the localization rate is still less than 10%, offering ample room for growth. Outstanding domestic companies are actively laying out a \"second growth curve,\" striving to move from sub-sector leadership to platform-based business models. Like pharmaceutical companies, local medtech firms are actively exploring new products and business lines to seek the next highlights of company growth. Leading domestic companies are expected to become even stronger.\n",

Since then, relevant departments have successively rolled out a series of policy documents, vigorously promoting the rapid development of charging infrastructure. Currently, China has built the world’s largest, most comprehensive charging infrastructure system in terms of quantity, service scope, and variety of types. Looking ahead, with the rapid growth of NEVs, especially electric vehicles, charging infrastructure still faces issues such as incomplete network layout, suboptimal structure, uneven service quality, and insufficiently standardized operations. These problems place higher and more urgent demands on building a high-quality charging infrastructure system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the General Office of the State Council issued the “Guiding Opinions on Further Building a High-Quality Charging Infrastructure System,” which provides top-level planning for building, in the new development stage, a high-quality system that is extensive in coverage, moderate in scale, rational in structure, and complete in function. The document clearly puts forward five major tasks: optimizing and improving network layout, accelerating construction in key areas, enhancing operational service quality, strengthening technological innovation leadership, and increasing support and safeguards. The document particularly emphasizes “three key principles”:\n",
      "1. Adhering to a systematic view, deploying and constructing a charging network with a planar layout in cities, linear layout along highways, and point-based layout in rural areas, based on the national transportation infrastructure network;\n",
      "2. Adhering to a goal-oriented approach, aiming to effectively meet people’s needs for travel charging by providing safe, reliable, economical, and convenient services;\n",
      "3. Adhering to a problem-oriented approach, focusing on the main bottlenecks and pain points of public concern and proposing highly actionable and pragmatic policy measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the NDRC and the National Energy Administration will continue to work with all parties to implement the “Guiding Opinions,” strengthen coordination and cooperation among departments, and enhance the guidance and supervision of local authorities to ensure the rapid and effective implementation of all measures.\n",

      "Q&A with Reporters\n",
      "\n",
      "Cover News Reporter:\n",
      "According to statistics, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued their rapid growth in May this year, which means huge demand for charging facilities. Could you update us on the current development status of charging infrastructure? How can charging infrastructure keep up with the rapid growth of NEVs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ou Hong:\n",
      "With the rapid development of China’s NEV industry, the construction of charging infrastructure has also made positive progress, mainly characterized by the following four features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Continuous expansion of scale.\n",
      "From 2015 to 2022, the number of charging facilities in China increased from less than 100,000 units to 5.21 million units, with an average annual increase of more than 700,000 units. Especially since 2021, both “vehicles” and “piles” have shown explosive, synchronized growth. As of the end of May this year, the total number of charging facilities has reached 6.356 million units.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Relatively reasonable structure.\n",
      "In terms of user attributes, both public and private needs are addressed: public charging piles account for about 33%, while private ones make up about 67%. In terms of charging modes, there is a mix of fast and slow charging, with small-power AC charging piles as the mainstay and large-power DC charging piles as a supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Improved coverage and layout.\n",
      "In major cities, the coverage rate of public charging facilities in central urban areas exceeds 80%, with service radii comparable to gas stations. Sixty-five percent of highway service areas nationwide are equipped with charging facilities, forming a preliminary “ten vertical, ten horizontal, two ring” expressway rapid-charging network.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Continuous technological improvement.\n",
      "Technical lines such as AC slow charging and DC fast charging have been formed, with growing compatibility between vehicles and charging piles. Charging efficiency, intelligent control, and safety monitoring technologies are internationally advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this basis, focusing on the rapid growth trend of electric vehicles, the “Guiding Opinions” propose the general objective of China’s charging infrastructure development: By 2030, a high-quality charging infrastructure system—broad in coverage, moderate in scale, rational in structure, and complete in function—will be basically completed, strongly supporting the development of the NEV industry and effectively meeting the charging needs of the public. In terms of network coverage, a city-wide, highway-linear, and rural point-based charging network will be built. In medium and large cities, the ratio of standardized-operating charging spaces in commercial parking lots is expected to exceed the ratio of registered urban EVs. In rural areas, charging service coverage will steadily improve. In functional and service terms, complementary use of slow and fast charging, intelligent open charging services, reliability, affordability, and completeness of standardization and regulation systems will be achieved, with industry oversight and governance capabilities basically modernized and technical equipment and innovation at world-leading levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing Youth Daily Reporter:\n",
      "My question relates to charging piles. You just mentioned that China’s charging infrastructure has indeed developed rapidly in recent years, but many NEV owners still have “range anxiety” and may encounter a range of problems, such as difficulty bringing charging piles into residential communities, difficulties charging along expressways, or simply finding a charging pile. How will you tackle these bottlenecks and difficulties and achieve “charging freedom”?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ou Hong:\n",
      "This is indeed a topic of public concern. As I mentioned earlier, the “Guiding Opinions” focus on the pain points and bottlenecks of public concern and propose highly operational, pragmatic, and effective policy measures. For the issues most strongly reflected by the public, such as “difficulty in finding charging piles,” “difficulty entering residential communities,” and “difficulty charging on highways,” the “Guiding Opinions” propose targeted solutions for each.\n",
      "\n",
      "For “difficulty in finding piles”:\n",
      "On one hand, strengthen charging infrastructure network coverage and build a structurally sound urban charging network, focusing on residential areas, office zones, commercial centers, industrial centers, and leisure centers. Accelerate effective charging infrastructure coverage in rural areas suitable for EV use. Vigorously promote the construction of public charging facilities in parking lots, accessible gas and service stations, and tourist attractions. On the other hand, construct information network platforms to ensure integration of all types of charging infrastructure. Encourage provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) to build regulatory and operational service platforms for charging infrastructure, strengthen data interconnection with EV, urban, and highway travel service networks, and use online map and other convenient means to timely publish information on the location and real-time status of public charging facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "For “difficulty entering residential communities”:\n",
      "The “Guiding Opinions” specifically call for actively promoting charging infrastructure construction in residential communities.\n",
      "1. In terms of installation, accelerate the installation of fixed-space charging facilities in existing residential communities wherever possible; in newly built communities, strictly ensure 100% of fixed parking spaces are equipped with charging infrastructure or pre-installed with necessary provisions.\n",
      "2. In terms of coordination, require cities to accelerate the development of guidance documents on managing charging facility construction in residential areas, optimize supportive policies and management procedures, clarify the responsibilities of sub-district offices and neighborhood committees, and establish a “one-stop” coordination and complaint-handling mechanism.\n",
      "3. In terms of service guarantee, encourage charging operators to take on owners’ commissions and uniformly provide services covering construction, operation, and maintenance; encourage the inclusion of charging infrastructure in the renovation of old residential areas, along with the necessary supporting power supply infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "For “difficulty charging on highways”:\n",
      "1. Build a convenient and efficient intercity charging network.\n",
      "Accelerate the filling of infrastructure gaps between key cities to meet demand for medium- and long-distance EV trips; expand expressway network charging infrastructure coverage, densify and optimize station distribution; and support scientific, site-specific deployment of charging facilities in service areas and stations on ordinary national and provincial highways where feasible.\n",
      "2. Strengthen expressway service area charging services.\n",
      "Require that new expressway service areas simultaneously build charging infrastructure; accelerate renovation of charging facilities in existing ones, and in principle, use large-power charging technology for new facilities. Deploy mobile charging facilities in areas with heavy traffic or during major holidays to enhance the network’s resilience.\n",
      "3. Build an interconnected urban cluster and metropolitan area charging network.\n",
      "Strengthen unified planning and coordinated construction of charging facilities to enhance EVs’ travel reach between and within metropolitan areas and key cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Paper Reporter:\n",
      "Currently, there are still some problems with China’s charging infrastructure, such as lack of unified standards and insufficiently standardized management. What measures does the new “Guiding Opinions” propose to resolve these issues? How will element guarantees in all aspects be strengthened?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ou Hong:\n",
      "At present, the overall development of the charging infrastructure industry in China faces problems such as insufficient support, low profitability, lack of unified standards, and inadequate regulation. The “Guiding Opinions” propose a series of concrete support policies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Increase price support.\n",
      "Implement time-of-use (“peak and valley”) electricity pricing policies. Before 2030, centralized charging and battery swapping facilities subject to two-part electricity prices are exempt from demand (capacity) electricity charges.\n",
      "2. Strengthen fundamental resource guarantees.\n",
      "Local governments at all levels are required to meet the development needs for land and corridor spaces for charging infrastructure and supporting power grids, and to consider providing financial support based on local conditions. Cities are encouraged to establish operational subsidies that are linked to service quality, increase subsidies for demonstration projects involving high-power charging and vehicle-grid interaction, and use local government special bonds, etc., to support eligible charging infrastructure projects.\n",
      "3. Improve financial service capabilities.\n",
      "Promote pledge-based financing using equity, project revenue rights, and franchise rights, and expand financing channels for charging infrastructure operating companies and equipment manufacturers through green bonds, etc. Encourage development financial institutions to innovate financing support models.\n",
      "4. Develop and implement unified standards.\n",
      "Continuously improve the standard system for charging infrastructure, strengthen version updates for construction, operation and maintenance, product performance, interoperability, and accelerate the formulation and revision of advanced charging and swapping technology standards, enhancing international leadership in standardization.\n",
      "5. Strengthen industry regulatory management.\n",
      "Improve industry access conditions and management policies, focus on regulated management and service quality for evaluation systems, hold EV, battery, and charging infrastructure manufacturers accountable for product quality and safety, enforce strict quality and safety management for charging infrastructure construction and installation, and improve the operation and maintenance system for charging infrastructure.\n",

      "Grasp the essence of “benchmarking” to make ancient books “important.” Letting the cultural relics in museums, the heritage displayed across the land, and the words written in ancient books all come alive, and promoting the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese civilization — these are earnest instructions given by General Secretary Xi Jinping. Currently, in some regions and departments, there is still insufficient understanding and awareness of ancient book utilization. This is evident in their narrow perspective, the misconception that ancient books are “useless”; a lack of basic knowledge leading to the belief that utilizing ancient books is “irrelevant”; and lagging work abilities resulting in a sense of “powerlessness” in ancient book use. These attitudes lead to shortages of funding, personnel, and capabilities for ancient book utilization. Some public institutions housing ancient books face high risks of deterioration due to restrictions in funding and staffing. Talents in storage management, consultation, organization, cataloging, authentication, and restoration are seriously lacking, and staff allocations are generally insufficient, making it difficult to smoothly advance the development and utilization of ancient books. To make ancient books “important,” we must elevate the work of ancient book utilization to the level of implementing General Secretary Xi’s important directives, emphasizing mission- and goal-oriented approaches, highlighting problem- and practice-oriented strategies, and taking a broader, longer-term, and more forceful approach to solving practical difficulties and bottlenecks in the utilization of ancient books. We should increase investment so that ancient book utilization “has the funds to get things done”; strengthen staffing so “there are people to get things done”; optimize the environment so “there is motivation to get things done”; and create a favorable pattern involving government departments, ancient book professionals, and social volunteers all participating — bringing to life the words that have long lain dormant in piles of old paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focus on “goals” to make ancient books “useful.” Proper use is the best protection for ancient books. Ancient books possess the value of documents, artifacts, and culture; if not used, they are useless — use leads to preservation, neglect leads to decay. At present, institutions in China that collect ancient books usually give priority to collection over utilization; in many places, rare ancient books are treated as treasures and kept sealed away with restricted access, so that the general public and researchers cannot freely view, organize, or publish them. The problem of departments working in isolation is prominent, there is a lack of awareness about sharing, and too much emphasis on management with insufficient openness. Some leaders of management institutions worry that experts will damage ancient books given access, and thus advocate for “ancient books to be managed by people who do not understand them, as this is safer and more reliable,” which severely restricts their development and utilization. The ultimate goal of ancient book preservation is to enable the public to better make use of public resources. We must correctly understand the principle of “prioritizing protection, focusing on rescue, rational utilization, and strengthened management”; avoid pitting preservation against development and utilization; break down institutional barriers; be considerate to readers, skilled in using ancient books, and responsible in protection; eliminate indiscriminate and unprofessional centralized management. We must strengthen regenerative protection for ancient books by compiling catalogs and illustrated records of collections, writing bibliographies and summaries, and publishing facsimiles, as well as providing catalog inquiry, reading, and reproduction services to the public. Special attention should be paid to constructing “digital ancient book” databases through full-color imaging digitization and microfilm conversion, making these resources open and accessible to the public, and providing online search and full-text reading—meeting the needs of researchers and readers alike. In this way, people can share traditional wisdom in various ways, have the opportunity to understand and study their own culture, and ultimately love and inherit their outstanding cultural traditions from the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Align the “coordinates” to make ancient books “vibrant.” For true and deep utilization of ancient books, they must become heartfelt and popular, reach ordinary people, permeate daily life, and integrate into the national spiritual DNA. Currently, the use of ancient books in China lacks sufficient breadth and depth in serving contemporary society, development, the public, and the nation; forms of utilization remain rather monotonous and rigid. Unlike intangible cultural heritage, ancient books have yet to truly enter society, capture the public’s attention, or wield wide influence. Chinese classics carry the spiritual bloodline of our country and nation; they need to be passed down through generations and innovated upon with the times. We must use all means to enliven the utilization of ancient books, following the example of CCTV’s large-scale cultural program “China in the Classics,” and use “drama + film + cultural interviews” to tell the stories behind the classics, promoting the creative transformation and innovative development of ancient book classics. It is important to promote ancient books through exhibitions, special lectures, simplified and popularized readers, loose-leaf scrolls, simulated “touchable” ancient books, and related documentaries, so the public can understand, become close to, and appreciate the beauty of the classics — truly feeling the profound heritage of Chinese culture. Only when young people fall in love with ancient books will they have a future. We need to strengthen the development of creative products related to ancient books, including cultural calendars, pocket scrolls, collectible cards, digital collectibles, research travel course designs, short videos, and H5 interactive content—melding the ancient with the modern, invigorating the classics, and fostering a cultural trend. In this way, ancient books can truly “move,” become “trendy,” “come alive,” and “awaken”—creating more vivid scenes characterized by deep experience, strong engagement, wide participation, and widespread acclaim.\n",

      "A few days ago, I read Mr. Liu Xiaohu's \"Children's Evening Classes,\" and this short essay stirred up memories from nearly seventy years ago. The children's evening class school was where my education began.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the autumn of 1954, it was time for me to start elementary school. My father took me to apply to Sichuan North Road First Elementary School. Elementary school entrance required an interview, though it was just the teacher asking some simple questions like: How old are you? What's your name? Where do you live? My mother had coached me many times before the exam, so naturally I answered fluently that day. But somehow, inexplicably, I wasn't accepted. The next day, my father took me to Liyang Road Elementary School for another try. They tested the same things, and I was accepted! But my parents weren't happy because this was a private school with expensive tuition. Public schools charged six yuan per semester, while private schools charged thirty yuan. With school starting soon, what could we do? A colleague of my father's suggested applying to children's evening classes, which ran from 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM, with cheap tuition of only two yuan. Without delay, I followed my father to yet another exam. Thus, just to attend elementary school, I took three entrance exams and caused adults much trouble before finally becoming a student at Tianshui Road Children's Evening Classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The school was located at the intersection of Tianshui Road and Liyang Road, with simple facilities. The campus was small, with only Class A and Class B, housed in two large single-story buildings. The desk surfaces were pitted and uneven - you couldn't write without a writing pad. Two children shared a long bench, and if one didn't sit steadily, the other might fall. Behind the classrooms was a row of low buildings that served as the teachers' office and toilets. The girls' toilet was a long ditch with wooden frames installed along three walls, covered with wooden boards with several round holes cut in the middle. At that time, my family lived at 1084 Liyang Road and used flush toilets, so I wasn't used to using the school facilities. Around 4 PM, the school would give the children soy milk, and when I felt the urge, I would always hold it in. One winter evening on the way home from school, I finally had an \"accident\" and cried all the way home. My family was waiting for dinner. My mother scolded me while helping me change and wash, while my father said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "My homeroom teacher was Zhu Bingxi, about the same age as my mother. She had short hair and often wore a Lenin suit. She taught Chinese and arithmetic and was very kind to students. She visited our home once, and when my mother was in her eighties, she still remembered Teacher Zhu when chatting about old times. The children loved music class most - singing was so joyful. The school had only one pedal organ, usually kept in the office, and children had to move it in and out before and after class. First-grade children didn't have the strength, so it took four boys working together. Before every music class, the little boys would compete to move the piano, and their voices were the loudest when singing. Back then we sang songs like \"The Newspaper Boy's Song,\" \"The Police Uncle is Very Capable,\" \"People of the World Unite,\" and \"Hey la la hey la la, hey la la hey la la, colorful clouds appear in the sky, red flowers bloom on the ground...\" Before singing, the teacher would first teach the children vocal exercises - \"Mi yi yi yi, ah ah ah ah\" - this training was tedious and boring, and we didn't like it.\n",

      "I only studied at the children's evening classes for three semesters. When my family moved to Sichuan North Road during the second semester of second grade, I transferred to Xinguang Road Elementary School. The new school had much better facilities, but I couldn't forget the children's evening classes. I still have two first-grade report cards, sized 32mo, in traditional characters, formatted from right to left in vertical writing. The front bears the words \"Student Grade Report,\" signed \"Shanghai North Sichuan Road District Tianshui Road Children's Evening Classes,\" with a line of small text: \"First Semester 1954.\" A round stamp is pressed over the signature, with six characters in the center: \"Children's Evening Classes Seal,\" the stamp still bright red. The inside left page is the \"Academic\" section, recording grades for five subjects: Chinese, arithmetic, physical education, music, and drawing. The right page is the \"Character\" section, with mid-term and final comments, plus records of rewards, punishments, and grade evaluations. My mother locked the report cards in a leather suitcase, and it wasn't until fifth grade when I had my own drawer that she gave them to me. These two pieces of paper are precious to me; from a broader perspective, they should now be considered historical artifacts.\n",

To this end: First, guide relevant enterprises to resume work in a precise and orderly manner by region and level, and cancel unreasonable approvals for work resumption. Coordinate and ensure the supply of masks and other epidemic prevention materials needed for work resumption. All localities should provide equal traffic convenience to postal services and express delivery companies of all ownership types, promote the removal of \"last kilometer\" traffic and delivery barriers in rural areas and communities, and include intelligent delivery facilities in the scope of urban and rural public infrastructure construction. Second, increase tax and fee reductions in stages. Continue to implement the policy of halving the collection of urban land use tax for bulk commodity storage land that expired at the end of last year for a certain period. From March 1 to June 30, waive port construction fees for import and export goods, reduce government-set charging standards for cargo port fees and port facility security fees by 20%, and cancel mandatory emergency response services and fees for non-tanker cargo ships.

      "BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- (Reporters Yang Yijun, Wang Bin) On May 16, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin jointly met with reporters at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after their talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi Jinping pointed out that President Putin's state visit to China is his first visit after beginning his new presidential term, which fully demonstrates the high importance that President Putin himself and Russia attach to developing China-Russia relations. I warmly welcome President Putin's visit. Just now, President Putin and I held candid, friendly and substantive talks, comprehensively summarizing the successful experience of bilateral relations over the 75 years since diplomatic ties were established, conducting in-depth exchanges of views on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of mutual concern, and making plans and arrangements for the development of bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields in the next stage. We also jointly signed and issued the \"Joint Statement of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on Deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for the New Era on the Occasion of the 75th Anniversary of Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries,\" and witnessed the signing of multiple important cooperation documents between the two governments and their departments, injecting new strong momentum into the healthy development of China-Russia relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi Jinping emphasized that this year marks the 75th anniversary of China-Russia diplomatic relations. Over three-quarters of a century, China-Russia relations have weathered storms and grown stronger over time. Particularly since the new era, the positioning of bilateral relations has continuously improved, cooperation content has become increasingly rich, and the concept of friendship for generations has taken deep root in people's hearts. China-Russia relations have become a model for new-type international relations and relations between major neighboring countries. China-Russia relations have achieved these remarkable accomplishments because both sides have consistently adhered to \"five principles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "First is adhering to mutual respect as the foundation, always supporting each other on core interest issues. President Putin and I unanimously believe that the reason China and Russia have been able to forge a new path for the development of relations between major countries and neighbors lies in mutual respect and equal treatment, always firmly supporting each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns. This is also the core essence of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era. Both sides will continue to uphold the principles of \"no alliance, no confrontation, and not targeting third parties,\" continuously deepen political mutual trust, respect each other's chosen development paths, and achieve respective development and revitalization through mutual firm support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second is adhering to win-win cooperation as the driving force, constructing a new pattern of mutual benefit between China and Russia. Last year, China-Russia bilateral trade exceeded $240 billion, an increase of nearly 1.7 times compared to 10 years ago. This is a microcosm of the two countries' continuous deepening of comprehensive mutually beneficial cooperation. President Putin and I unanimously believe that we should actively seek convergence points of the two countries' interests, leverage respective advantages, deepen interest integration, and achieve mutual accomplishment. We should further optimize cooperation structure, consolidate the good momentum of cooperation in traditional fields such as trade and economy, support the establishment of basic scientific research platform networks, continuously release cooperation potential in frontier fields, strengthen port and transportation logistics cooperation, and maintain the stability of global industrial and supply chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third is adhering to friendship for generations as the foundation, jointly passing on the torch of China-Russia friendship. Both China and Russia have long histories and brilliant cultures. Works by Pushkin and Tolstoy are household names in China, while Chinese traditional culture such as Peking opera and Tai Chi are deeply loved by the Russian people. Currently, both sides are continuously expanding cooperation in the humanities field with the implementation of the \"China-Russia Roadmap for Humanities Cooperation Before 2030\" as the main line. President Putin and I have jointly designated this year and next as \"China-Russia Year of Culture,\" proposing that both sides should hold a series of down-to-earth, heart-connecting, and vibrant cultural exchange activities, encouraging various sectors and regions of both countries to strengthen exchanges, better promoting mutual understanding and affinity between peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth is adhering to strategic coordination as support, leading the correct direction of global governance. Both sides firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, closely coordinate and cooperate on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, APEC, and G20, promoting world multipolarity and economic globalization through genuine multilateralism. This year, Russia serves as the rotating chair of BRICS, and China will assume the rotating chairmanship of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization within the year. Both sides will mutually support each other's chairmanship work, build a more comprehensive, close, pragmatic, and inclusive high-quality partnership, and unite and strengthen the \"Global South.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth is adhering to fairness and justice as the purpose, committed to promoting political solutions to hotspot issues. In today's world, Cold War mentality lingers, and unilateral hegemony, camp confrontation, and power politics threaten world peace and the security of all countries. President Putin and I unanimously believe that resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is urgent. We must effectively implement UN resolutions and resolve the Palestinian issue based on the \"two-state solution.\" Both sides unanimously believe that political resolution of the Ukraine crisis is the right direction. China's position on this issue is consistent and clear, including adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, respecting the legitimate security concerns of all parties, and building a balanced, effective, and sustainable new security architecture. China looks forward to the early restoration of peace and stability on the European continent and is willing to continue playing a constructive role in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi Jinping pointed out that mountains are formed by accumulating earth, and seas are formed by accumulating water. After 75 years of solid accumulation, the friendship for generations and comprehensive cooperation between China and Russia have converged into strong momentum for both sides to fear no storms and move forward continuously. Standing at a new historical starting point, China and Russia will always stick to their original aspirations and work together responsibly, bringing more benefits to the peoples of both countries and making due contributions to world security and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin expressed that shortly after President Xi Jinping's re-election last year, he made a state visit to Russia, and my choice of China as the first country to visit after my re-election once again demonstrates the special nature and high level of Russia-China relations, as well as the high importance both Russia and China attach to further deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. Over the 75 years since Russia-China diplomatic relations were established, bilateral relations have developed into a model for partnership relations between major countries and neighbors, with rich cooperation content and fruitful results. I have maintained close communication and good relations with President Xi Jinping. Both sides are satisfied with the current state of Russia-China relations and are full of confidence in future cooperation. Russia regards China as a long-term reliable partner and is willing to continuously expand cooperation with China in political, economic, cultural, educational, security and other fields, successfully hold the \"Russia-China Year of Culture,\" and deepen people-to-people exchanges. Russia and China maintain close coordination on the international stage, jointly committed to promoting the establishment of a more democratic multipolar world order, and are willing to continue strengthening cooperation within frameworks such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as well as communication on major international and regional issues, promoting regional and world peace and development.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the early 1980s, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker brought down U.S. inflation from double digits in early 1980 through sustained aggressive rate hikes, but at the cost of the U.S. economy falling into recession twice within two years, known as the \"Volcker moment.\" Now facing sustained high inflation not seen in forty years, will the Fed repeat history by controlling inflation at the cost of recession?\n",

      "**Aggressive Rate Hikes Struggle to Curb Inflation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fed Chair Powell said at the post-meeting press conference that another \"unusually large\" rate hike might be appropriate at the September meeting. The CME FedWatch tool showed on July 27 that traders expect a 65% probability of a 50 basis point rate hike in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consecutive large rate hikes highlight the Fed's passive position of having acted slowly earlier and now having to accelerate inflation control. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 9.1% year-over-year in June, the highest increase in nearly 41 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Xinhua that no positive progress in alleviating inflation has been seen so far, which is expected. There are lags in Fed policy transmission, and inflation deceleration may not become apparent until the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "While inflation remains stubbornly high, the impact of Fed rate hikes on the economy is increasingly apparent. Powell noted at the press conference that recent spending and production indicators have softened, with consumer spending growth slowing significantly, reflecting factors such as declining real disposable income and tightening financial conditions. Housing market activity has weakened, partly due to rising mortgage rates. He does not believe the U.S. has entered an economic recession, but he admitted that the path for the U.S. economy to avoid recession and achieve a \"soft landing\" has narrowed and could become even narrower.\n",

      "\n",
      "American Enterprise Institute economist Desmond Lachman expects the U.S. economy may fall into recession by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CNBC survey of fund managers, analysts, and economists shows that 63% of respondents believe Fed policy will lead to economic recession. They believe there is more than a 50% chance the U.S. economy will fall into recession within the next 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Global Interests Face Another Harvest**\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, the Fed's monetary policy tightening has already brought significant spillover effects. Lachman pointed out that U.S. rate hikes have already caused substantial capital outflows from emerging markets, similar to previous rate hike cycles. This is causing significant depreciation of emerging market currencies and raising debt risks for highly indebted emerging market economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the view of some economists, the current U.S. economic policy path seems familiar: massive borrowing and money printing when facing major economic shocks earlier, using low dollar financing costs to stimulate the economy; after excess dollar liquidity combined with economic recovery pushes up global inflation, the Fed tightens monetary policy, prompting capital to flow back to the U.S., ultimately leaving many countries suffering the double blow of malignant inflation and capital outflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roubini believes that current global debt levels are far higher than in the 1970s, and the Fed's aggressive rate hikes to suppress inflation will bring more severe consequences than then, \"possibly leading to economic depression.\"\n",

Students eagerly told Michelle about their experiences in China, from urban cultural experiences to food tastings, covering everything in detail. They also taught Michelle practical Chinese phrases like \"hello,\" \"my name is Michelle,\" and \"goodbye,\" believing these would be very useful during Michelle's China visit.

      "Dan Blumenthal, former China advisor to the Bush administration, said that before Obama's Asia trip in April, his wife's China visit is of profound significance, with the White House hoping Michelle's China trip will be \"sweet and full of highlights.\" Blumenthal believes that Michelle need only play her role as First Lady well for the visit to be successful, without shouldering the task of discussing sensitive issues.\n",

      "DALIAN (Reporter Wu Lin, Correspondent Li Tianran) - The Dalian Assistance Management Station has been exploring humane and family-oriented assistance methods, taking the lead nationwide in launching the \"One Yuan Account\" assistance service brand, which has since been promoted in multiple locations. Over the 10 years since this service began, it has provided temporary assistance to 7,046 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of March this year, a young man surnamed Zhang came to the assistance station for help. He had come to Dalian on a business trip from another city and accidentally lost his wallet, leaving him without money to buy a train ticket home. The assistance station provided him with a \"one yuan\" public savings account. The young man called his family, and after more than half an hour, his family transferred 1,000 yuan to the public account. Station staff accompanied the young man to withdraw the money. His anxious heart was finally at ease, and he successfully bought a ticket home.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Dalian Assistance Management Station, nearly a thousand such incidents occur each year, with many people facing temporary difficulties resolving their urgent needs through the \"One Yuan Account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as August 2003, as the management system for vagrant beggars changed from detention and repatriation to assistance management, the Dalian Assistance Management Station launched the \"One Yuan Account\" assistance service brand. Using \"one yuan\" as the base amount to open accounts in the banking system, people seeking help can call familiar relatives and friends to transfer money to the account, then withdraw it together with staff members, achieving a self-help effect. During the 2013 Spring Festival alone, among those assisted by the Dalian Assistance Management Station, 12 people who had been robbed or defrauded and left penniless ultimately achieved self-help through the \"One Yuan Account\" service, purchasing tickets in time and successfully returning home for the New Year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practical work, the \"One Yuan Account\" serves two functions: First, it innovates screening methods and combats ticket fraud and station-hopping phenomena. The \"One Yuan Account\" makes it clear at a glance when distinguishing between genuine and fake help-seekers. Second, it expands the scope of assistance, resolving urgent needs for some people who don't meet assistance criteria and other help recipients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on the \"One Yuan Account\" service brand, the Dalian Assistance Management Station has also launched a series of innovative projects: cooperating with job placement agencies to provide free job referral services for help-seekers; opening assistance consultation windows at train stations to facilitate ticket inquiries and purchases for assisted persons; connecting with legal aid centers to provide legal assistance for people left penniless due to fraud, robbery, theft, and other reasons; and taking the lead nationwide in simultaneously establishing a \"three blogs, one website, one message\" assistance service platform to achieve information sharing in assistance work.\n",

      "Science and Technology Daily (Reporter Jie Manbin) - On August 7, a Science and Technology Daily reporter learned from Lanzhou University that Professor Fan Zengjie and Professor Liu Bin's team from the university's School of Stomatology, in collaboration with Professor Sun Luyi's team from the University of Connecticut in the United States, proposed a new strategy for promoting wound healing and preventing scar formation in diabetic patients through self-powered enzyme-linked microneedle (MN) patches. The related research findings were recently published in \"Science Advances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyperglycemia, bacterial infection, and chronic inflammation are the main pathological factors that make diabetic wounds difficult to heal. Additionally, like other wounds, diabetic wounds often develop scars after healing, which remains one of the unresolved clinical challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting the pathological characteristics of diabetic wounds, this research fully utilized the technical advantages of microneedle patches, including minimal invasiveness, painlessness, and self-fixation, combined with the characteristics of biofuel cells that can use glucose as fuel, have good biocompatibility, and generate stable and lasting current. The team innovatively designed and manufactured a self-powered enzyme-linked MN patch. The patch consists of anode and cathode MN arrays, which respectively contain glucose oxidase (GOX) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encapsulated in ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Through enzymatic cascade reactions in the MN patch, it can effectively reduce local hyperglycemia in diabetic wounds while generating stable microcurrent to promote rapid healing of diabetic wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research results show that after treating diabetic wounds (with a wound area of 1 square centimeter) with this MN patch, rapid and complete healing of diabetic wounds can be achieved within 3 weeks, effectively preventing scar formation. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of the MN patch's glucose-lowering, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and bioelectric stimulation properties. Therefore, this research proposes an effective method for promoting rapid healing of diabetic wounds and preventing scar formation, which is expected to change the status quo of difficult-to-heal wounds in diabetic patients.\n",

The landing site for this mission was the Dongfeng landing site, which is geographically far from cities in the Gobi Desert with poor signal coverage, relying only on satellites for signal support. The advantages of satellite communication's wide coverage, unlimited communication distance, and strong environmental adaptability were fully utilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this Shenzhou-13 return capsule landing site support mission, satellite communication stations reached a record-breaking 14 sites. These stations were divided into two groups, providing live broadcast coverage for multiple media outlets on site and network communication for operators' temporary 4G/5G satellite base stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liang Enci stated that for this support mission, two engineers were deployed on-site for service, support engineers were arranged at the gateway station, and a dedicated support team was arranged at the Shenzhen Satellite Telemetry and Control Center. A week in advance, they maintained all involved equipment and arranged backup equipment to ensure mission success.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is reported that in addition to providing high-definition live broadcasts and media coverage for major missions such as Shenzhou-13, Shenzhou-12, and Chang'e-5, \"Shenzhen Star\" also leverages its high communication capacity advantage to provide communication services for thousands of terminals including aircraft, ships, offshore drilling platforms, and emergency vehicles. Currently, \"Shenzhen Star\" has achieved broadband coverage for China, ASEAN, Japan, Russia, India, Australia, Hawaii and other regions, with approximately one-third of the Earth's surface being within \"Shenzhen Star's\" service range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving communication network challenges at the landing site\n",
      "\n",
      "As a participating unit in search and rescue communication support at the landing site, another Shenzhen enterprise, Feisi Communications, provided high-quality communication network environment for the safe return of the Shenzhou-13 manned spacecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, this is the world's first application of phased array broadband satellite communication technology in astronaut return communication support. This phased array broadband satellite communication system, based on the \"Shenzhen Star\" satellite, solves communication network challenges when ground communication infrastructure is scarce at the landing site.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The equipment takes only about two minutes from startup to use, ensuring immediate use in any emergency situation,\" said a relevant person in charge at Feisi Communications. The biggest feature of this equipment is its compact and lightweight design, facilitating on-site communication support vehicles to depart for landing areas at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to reports, spacecraft landing ranges are generally quite large areas, and on-site communication support vehicles must change deployment locations frequently. Traditional mechanical scanning equipment requires a long time from startup to satellite connection, and frequent restarts greatly affect search and rescue missions. In contrast, phased array terminal equipment has a short startup-to-use time and can be used while traveling at high speeds, ensuring broadband network coverage and live broadcast support in areas without networks or fiber optic coverage. This is equivalent to establishing a high-speed mobile base station on site.\n",

      "In addition to \"Shenzhen Star,\" there was another \"Shenzhen-made\" product accompanying the three astronauts on their space \"business trip\" - Fiyta aerospace watches. Since Shenzhou-5, Fiyta aerospace watches have entered space with Chinese astronauts eight times.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Shenzhou-12, Shenzhou-13, and space station missions, Fiyta delivered three categories of aerospace watches: intravehicular spacesuit watches, ground training work watches, and extravehicular spacesuit watches, respectively undertaking three important timing functions: intravehicular spacesuit leak detection timing, work auxiliary timing, and spacewalk redundancy timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this Shenzhou-13 return mission, the intravehicular spacesuit watch provided leak detection timing function for astronauts. As one of the exemplars of Shenzhen watchmaking, Fiyta aerospace watches precisely recorded every second of exploration.

      "\n",
      "In accordance with the spirit of Order No. 3 issued by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and the Ministry of Finance, namely the \"Interim Measures for the Administration of Enterprise State-Owned Property Rights Transfers,\" and to promote the orderly circulation of state-owned property rights, fully leverage the fundamental role of property rights trading markets in resource allocation, utilize market price discovery mechanisms to make state-owned property rights and asset transfers more open, transparent, scientific, and reasonable, and ensure maximum value appreciation of state-owned assets during circulation, the Liaoning SASAC recently issued the \"Notice on On-Market Trading of Enterprise State-Owned Property Rights Transfers\" (Liao Guozi [2006] No. 119) to address issues discovered during annual inspections of enterprise state-owned property rights transfers in Liaoning Province, further standardizing the province's on-market trading behavior for enterprise state-owned property rights transfers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Notice clarifies the scope of on-market trading for enterprise state-owned property rights: state-owned enterprise property rights transfers, state-owned equity transfers in corporate enterprises, enterprise restructuring through capital increase and share expansion by state-owned and state-controlled enterprises (entities), transfers of tangible assets, claims, intellectual property rights, patents, trademarks, goodwill, proprietary technologies and other intangible assets by state-owned and state-controlled enterprises, asset (property) disposal by bankrupt enterprises, disposal of state-owned assets involved in litigation, transfers of state-owned equity (property rights) in state-participated enterprises, and other state-owned asset transfer activities must all be conducted openly in legally established property rights trading institutions with qualifications for state-owned property rights trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Notice designates Shenyang United Property Rights Exchange, Dalian Property Rights Exchange, and their approved branch institutions as the property rights trading institutions for enterprises in Liaoning Province to conduct state-owned property rights and asset transfers, breaking down geographical restrictions. It further standardizes transfer methods and listing reference criteria: enterprise state-owned property rights (equity) and asset transfers may be conducted through auction, bidding, competitive pricing, negotiated transfer, and other methods stipulated by national laws and administrative regulations. Cases that generate only one transferee through public solicitation or are approved by provincial state-owned assets supervision and administration institutions may proceed with on-site negotiated transfers. Enterprise state-owned property rights (equity) and asset transfers must use asset evaluation results approved or filed by state-owned assets supervision and administration institutions as reference criteria for listing in property rights trading institutions. The Notice also sets corresponding requirements for municipal state-owned assets supervision and administration institutions and property rights trading institutions.\n",

      "CHONGQING, August 1 (Reporter Zhang Guosheng, Special Correspondent Li Hong) - On the morning of August 1, the sun blazed overhead, but 28-year-old Yu Xiaoming was unusually excited. Having just finished work, he didn't even stop for lunch before hurrying to the household registration reform application window for rural-to-urban conversion at the Guanyinqiao Police Station in Jiangbei District, Chongqing, clutching his property deed, marriage certificate, and household registration booklet to submit application materials for his family to become urban residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first day that all 807 police stations citywide began accepting applications from rural residents to convert to urban household registration since Chongqing launched its comprehensive urban-rural household registration system reform. Yu Xiaoming, from Group 7 of Renhe Village, Longhe Town, Changshou District, Chongqing, became the first rural resident whose conversion application was officially accepted by Guanyinqiao Police Station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yu Xiaoming, who has only a junior high school education, has been working in Chongqing with his family of three for six years and currently works as a chef at a restaurant in Chongqing. In 2007, he purchased a 44-square-meter commercial apartment in Taping, Jiangbei District, Chongqing, finally securing a permanent residence in the city. However, now that his child has reached school age, the high sponsorship fees required for non-urban household registration have become a problem for Yu Xiaoming's family. Over the years, due to limitations in education and housing conditions, Yu Xiaoming's family's desire to become urban residents could never be realized. Now, with Chongqing launching the reform of its comprehensive urban-rural household registration system, many previous restrictions on rural-to-urban conversion have been eliminated, and Yu Xiaoming's family's dream of becoming urban residents has smoothly become reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate goal of Chongqing becoming a pilot zone for comprehensive urban-rural coordinated reform is to ensure that rural residents, migrant workers in cities, and their families enjoy equal rights, equalized public services, and homogeneous living conditions as urban residents in all aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of this household registration system reform represents a substantive step toward achieving the above goals for Chongqing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting the reality that Chongqing is \"a major exporter and employer of migrant workers,\" this round of household registration reform takes qualified migrant workers, especially new-generation migrant workers, as a breakthrough point, while simultaneously resolving historical household registration issues including those whose land was requisitioned by the government over the years but who haven't converted to non-agricultural status, and farmers who lost land due to major water conservancy projects but haven't converted from agricultural status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guo Jinyan, Political Commissar of the Public Security Management Corps of Chongqing Public Security Bureau, said that according to the overall urban-rural planning, converted residents will be distributed across three major areas: the main urban area, district and county towns, and small townships. The main urban area, as the urban core, has conditions set as: working or doing business in the main urban area for more than five years; purchasing complete commercial housing; investing in establishing enterprises with cumulative tax payments of 100,000 yuan over three years or over 50,000 yuan in one year. It is expected that by 2020, the main urban area will have 10 million urban residents. Based on population numbers, by that time, the main urban area's population will be equivalent to 10 megacities.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Albas cashmere goats growing on the Ordos Plateau are a nationally protected livestock and poultry genetic resource breed. However, due to lack of scientific breed protection awareness and methods, Albas cashmere goats once faced a crisis of crossbreeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breeding high-quality breeding stock is key. In 1983, the Otog Banner government invested in establishing the Albas Cashmere Goat Breeding Farm (now Inner Mongolia Yiwei White Cashmere Goat Co., Ltd.), introducing a batch of purebred Albas cashmere goats from Wurenduxi Mountain for selective breeding and reproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sun Guojun, head of Yiwei Company, explained that as the number of breeding goats continued to increase, breeding difficulty also grew, making the traditional extensive breeding model unsustainable. To address this, various breeding farms began transitioning to intensive breeding. Yiwei Company subdivided breeding goat types according to gender, growth stages and other dimensions, establishing 33 breeding herd sites and hiring local farmers and herders to manage them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breeds must be preserved and also improved in quality. In recent years, Otog Banner has actively built industry-academia-research exchange platforms, cooperating with universities such as China Agricultural University and Inner Mongolia University to continuously improve the genetic quality of Albas cashmere goats. \"The application of a series of new technologies and methods has increased the average annual cashmere yield of our breeding goats from less than 300 grams in the past to 750 grams, while maintaining an average cashmere fineness of 14.5 microns,\" said Sun Guojun.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, come...\" Accompanied by coach Wang Lin's loud guidance, Di Dongdong, the men's T11 long jump athlete at the Paris Paralympics, sprinted, accelerated, and leaped to achieve a distance of 6.85 meters, successfully defending his title with absolute dominance and breaking a world record that had stood for ten years. The image of Di Dongdong wearing an eyepatch and leaping with all his might in darkness has been etched in the hearts of Chinese people.\n",
      "\n",
      "After returning from Paris to his home in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, Di Dongdong can still recall the excitement and cheers at the Olympic venue. \"People who can't see have particularly sensitive hearing. After that jump, I heard the cheers of fifty to sixty thousand spectators at the venue, so I guessed the result should be good.\" Although he cannot see, when he served as flag bearer waving the national flag at the Paris Paralympics closing ceremony, he felt the magnificent momentum. \"I felt very confident and proud to bring glory to the country. As a Chinese person, I felt particularly proud!\" ● Reported by Hong Kong Wen Wei Po correspondent Yu Jialin from Liaoning\n",
      "\n",
      "Di Dongdong was born in Liaoning Province in 1993. At age 6, he developed severe glaucoma and suffered an accident that caused retinal detachment, resulting in first-degree disability. He joined the Liaoning Provincial Paralympic Athletics Team in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could hear that the atmosphere at the venue was very good, but actually that day, due to the low temperature, my muscles were very tight.\" Despite having achieved remarkable results, when talking about each takeoff, Di Dongdong admits he still needs strong mental fortitude to resist worries about the unknown. T11 category athletes refer to visually impaired athletes with the highest level of disability participating in track or jumping events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Injured During Competition Jump, Overcame Mental Barriers to Rise Again\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My start has its own rhythm. Everyone saw the video of Coach Wang Lin shouting 'come, come, come' and thought that was my rhythm, but it's not.\" He told Hong Kong Wen Wei Po that on the field, the rhythm of acceleration running depends on day-after-day intensive training to achieve the best condition, while the most crucial takeoff tests an athlete's psychological quality the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In 2017, I started getting into long jump.\" At that time, Di Dongdong had already undergone more than four years of professional sprint training. \"I thought it wouldn't be that difficult.\" At the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, one of Di Dongdong's jumps landed outside the sand pit, causing a foot injury. \"That was my first international long jump competition. I didn't have much fear, but after that injury, I developed a psychological barrier. When running, I wasn't very daring, always thinking what if I jump off course and get injured again, which would affect the entire training and competition.\" After experiencing a low point, the stubborn Di Dongdong started over. \"Slowly adjusting my mindset and encouraging myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the coaching team and Liaoning Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation's logistics support focused on providing as much safety protection as possible during his daily training - practicing takeoffs not in the sand pit but on relatively soft and safe tracks, and when gradually transitioning to sand pit training, custom-made soft mats ensured no injury even if jumping off course... The establishment of a sense of security allowed Di Dongdong to gradually break through the darkness in his heart. \"It took about two years to adjust. My biggest feeling is that you must trust the coach - he is my eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Guide Runner Uses Rope to Establish Running Direction Sense\n",
      "\n",
      "At the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics, Di Dongdong already won gold in the long jump event. From starting professional training at the Liaoning Provincial Disabled Persons Sports Training and Rehabilitation Center in 2013 to beginning long jump training in 2017, he became world champion in just 4 years. Di Dongdong admits this was backed by day-after-day, hundreds and thousands of times of hard training. Having shown athletic talent since childhood, due to visual impairment and an accident in elementary school that left him with first-degree disability to complete blindness, he completed repeated \"comebacks\" in life in complete darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our training plan is formulated with reference to able-bodied athletes.\" When initially practicing sprints, running a perfect straight line was his persistent goal. \"Because we need guide runners to cooperate, unlike able-bodied people who can run by themselves, it's much simpler for them.\" Using a rope to connect himself with the guide runner's hand, \"able-bodied athletes might achieve training effects by running 10 or 20 times, but we need hundreds or thousands of times.\" Repetitive and monotonous training was to establish a sense of direction in darkness. \"The guide runner's voice is direction for me. The position where you saw the coach standing by the sand pit at this Paris Paralympics is also the result of our repeated adjustments and training.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two to Three Years of Adjustment to Find More Suitable Positioning\n",
      "\n",
      "From front and back of the takeoff area to front and back of the takeoff board, then to the sand pit edge, coach Wang Lin's position underwent multiple adjustments in different periods. \"It also took two to three years to find a position more suitable for me.\" At this year's World Championships in May, the master and apprentice discovered new problems with the previous positioning. \"At that time, he was shouting from in front of the takeoff area. During his retreat, as I ran closer and closer, I would instinctively dodge, naturally thinking whether I was about to collide.\" Finally, the master and apprentice presented their optimal positioning at the Paris Paralympics.\n",

      "\"Han Shi\" was originally a text of the Book of Songs transmitted by the Confucian scholar Han Ying during the early Western Han period. Later, as Han Ying's academic influence gradually expanded, it eventually formed an academic school with Han Ying's interpretation of the \"Shi\" as the main body and the developments of Han Ying's disciples as tributaries. The Han Shi school was quite substantial in scale and was one of the three major official representatives of Book of Songs studies in the Han dynasty, particularly \"flourishing in the Eastern Han\" (Qing dynasty Tang Yan's \"Academic Cases of the Two Han and Three Kingdoms\"). The Han Shi school produced numerous academic works, but by the transition between the two Song dynasties, except for the \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" (External Commentary on Han Shi), all other works had been lost. Han Shi literature thus divided into two categories: one being the \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" that has been transmitted to the present day, and the other being the long-lost works of Han Shi. The two, one visible and one hidden, profoundly influenced their respective transmission paths and characteristics. This phenomenon was particularly evident in the process of Han Shi literature's transmission to Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Han Shi literature became known to Japanese academic circles quite early. The most direct evidence is that the ten-volume \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" was already catalogued in Japan's earliest extant catalog of Chinese books, \"Nihon-koku Genzai Shomokuroku: Poetry Category.\" This book was compiled by Fujiwara no Sukeyoshi (847-898) in the third year of Kanpyō (891), corresponding to the second year of Dashun under Tang Emperor Zhaozong, indicating that \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" had been transmitted to Japan no later than the Tang dynasty. Subsequently, \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" had stable transmission in Japan, which was mainly manifested in the following three aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, many passages from \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" frequently appeared in encyclopedias and character excerpts from the Heian period onward in Japan, indicating that the \"Wai Zhuan\" had relatively widespread transmission in Japanese intellectual circles, so many maxims and stories from the book were often selected by ancient Japanese texts. At the same time, some Chinese classics that were transmitted to Japan also accelerated the transmission of \"Wai Zhuan\" in Japan. For example, Volume 8 of \"Qunshu Zhiyao\" compiled by Tang dynasty Wei Zheng excerpted some content from \"Wai Zhuan\" (Kanazawa Bunko still preserves a Kamakura period manuscript copy). This book had enormous influence in Japanese academic circles, and its excerpts of \"Wai Zhuan\" should have positively contributed to the transmission of \"Wai Zhuan\" during Japan's manuscript era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, after the 17th century, Japan saw the emergence of multiple Japanese-printed editions of \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan,\" which greatly promoted the transmission of this book in Japanese academic circles. The earliest extant Japanese-printed \"Wai Zhuan\" is the edition carved by Kyoto bookshop Katsumura Jihiemon in the second year of Jōō (1653), preserved in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Japanese academic circles call it the \"Katsumura edition.\" Takahashi Ryōsei's \"Bibliographical Study of Japanese-printed Han Shi Wai Zhuan - On the Katsumura Edition\" (Shibunkai No. 112, 2004) conducted in-depth research on this edition and can be consulted for reference. The edition of \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" carved by Seibundō in the ninth year of Hōreki (1759), preserved in Japan's National Archives, also has distinctive features. This edition was collated by Torimunenari, with training point characters on the right side of each line of main text, and scattered collation notes written in the page margins, partially displaying Japanese scholars' collation achievements regarding \"Wai Zhuan.\" However, it should be noted that Japan's collation and carving of \"Wai Zhuan\" at this time actually originated from Chinese Ming dynasty printed editions. For example, the Katsumura edition's base text was the Xue Lai Furong Quan Study edition from the 18th year of Jiajing (1539), and the Seibundō edition's base text was the Cheng Rong \"Han Wei Congshu\" edition from the 22nd year of Wanli (1594). This indicates that Japanese academic circles' publication of \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" was greatly influenced by China. In other words, it was the flourishing trend of \"Wai Zhuan\" publication in Ming dynasty China that triggered the enthusiasm for printing this book in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, from the late 18th century to the present, Japanese academic circles have produced various monographs studying \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan,\" thus achieving the transmission of \"Wai Zhuan\" at the academic research level. This represents that the transmission of \"Wai Zhuan\" in Japan entered a more mature stage, to the extent that during the Edo period, academic circles had already produced various index works for \"Wai Zhuan\" (see Sakamoto Muneko's \"Book Catalog by Publisher After Kyōhō\"), which was obviously a result accompanying the increasingly flourishing research on \"Wai Zhuan.\" From Okamoto Yasutaka's (1797-1878) \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan Kaoyi\" and Kawame Naota's \"Annotated Han Shi Wai Zhuan\" produced in the Edo and Meiji periods, to Itō Michiatsu's \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan Kōsen\" (only volumes 1 and 2 are extant) and Yoshida Teruko's \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan Translation and Annotation\" produced in the 20th century, all conducted in-depth research on \"Wai Zhuan\" with their respective focuses, containing many valuable insights. Yoshida Teruko was the first scholar in Japanese academic circles known specifically for researching \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan,\" and wrote nearly twenty papers comparing \"Wai Zhuan\" with other Qin and Han classics, many containing insights not discovered by predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the orderly transmission characteristics of \"Han Shi Wai Zhuan,\" the transmission of Han Shi lost works in Japan appeared rather scattered, which was directly related to the early loss of Han Shi lost works. Overall, the Han Shi lost work texts preserved in Japanese classics earliest came from Chinese encyclopedias (such as \"Xiuwen Dian Yulan\"), character dictionaries (such as Gu Yewang's original \"Yupian\"), phonetic and semantic books (such as Huiling's \"Yiqie Jing Yinyi\"), annotation books (such as Li Shan's \"Wenxuan Zhu\"), and lost books (such as Du Taiqing's \"Yuzhu Baodian\"). These classics all cited texts from Han Shi lost works to varying degrees, so after their transmission to the East, they opened the door for the transmission of Han Shi lost works in Japan. As the influence of these classics gradually expanded, many Japanese scholars incorporated the Han Shi lost work texts contained within them into their own writings, further expanding the transmission of Han Shi lost works in Japanese academic circles. According to the author's investigation, Japanese works that transcribed Han Shi lost work texts were mainly encyclopedias, character excerpts, and legal codes. These three types of literature constituted the basic media for the transmission of Han Shi lost works in Japan. Encyclopedias originated in China and gradually attracted attention from intellectual circles after being transmitted to Japan, subsequently giving rise to a trend of compiling encyclopedias. Since Japanese encyclopedias drew from Chinese encyclopedias, the Han Shi remnant theories recorded in the latter were often transcribed during the compilation process of the former. For example, the Han Shi lost works quoted in \"Yōgaku Shinan Shō\" originated from the Chinese encyclopedia \"Chuxue Ji.\" Character excerpts were a new format developed during the encyclopedia compilation process. What distinguished them from encyclopedias was that while encyclopedias covered relatively broad categories, character excerpts often targeted specific categories, so character excerpt works were usually more specialized, only collecting materials related to the theme. For example, \"Kōji Shō\" excerpted literature all related to incense, and when Han Shi lost works interpreted \"fragrant and aromatic filial sacrifice\" in \"Xiaoya Chuci,\" they happened to have the text \"fu means the appearance of fragrance,\" thus being excerpted into \"Kōji Shō.\" Legal code works, when explaining the meanings of legal terms, also often collected the exegesis from Han Shi lost works. For example, both Koremune Naomoto's \"Ryōshū Ge\" and Koremune Masasuke's \"Seiji Yōryaku\" cited a certain number of Han Shi lost work texts. From the above, it can be seen that Japanese encyclopedias, character excerpts, and legal works were the main media for the transmission of Han Shi lost works in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it is necessary to explore the transmission groups of Han Shi lost works in Japan. From currently available historical materials, this group mainly included the following three major strata: the power stratum composed of emperors and court nobles, the official academic stratum composed of university dormitory instructors and university students, and monks constituting people outside secular society. Emperors ordered court nobles to compile encyclopedias, often collecting a certain number of Han Shi fragments. For example, Tōgū scholar Shigeno Sadanushi, under the command of Emperor Junna, compiled the large encyclopedia \"Hifu Ryaku,\" which included Han Shi fragments, promoting the transmission of Han Shi fragments in intellectual circles. University dormitory instructors and students made their living by teaching and receiving the Book of Songs, and their important reference books included Lu Deming's \"Jingdian Shiwen.\" This book can be called a repository for preserving Han Shi exegetical fragments. When university dormitory instructors and students studied \"Jingdian Shiwen,\" they inevitably had to deal with the large number of Han Shi fragments cited in the book, which similarly promoted the transmission of these fragments in academic circles. The monk stratum, leveraging the peaceful environment and rich book collections of temples, quietly contributed to the transmission of Han Shi fragments. For example, both Kakumyō's \"Sankyō Shiki Chū\" and Shinzui's \"Jōdo Sanbu Kyō Ongi Shū\" cited Han\n",

      "\n",
      "Academician Zhu Futang, founder of Beijing Children's Hospital, proposed the hospital motto of \"Public Service, Compassion, Diligence, and Harmony\" at the founding of New China. Generations of pediatric medical professionals have upheld these four principles, saving lives and protecting children's health. This spirit serves as an important source for Beijing Children's Hospital's efforts to integrate core values into work and life. On the 7th, the 89th \"Core Values Hundred Lectures\" event was held at Beijing Children's Hospital. Hospital Director Ni Xin stated that this represents both full recognition of the hospital's work in cultivating and practicing core values, and sets higher requirements for inheriting and promoting the hospital motto of \"Public Service, Compassion, Diligence, and Harmony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Ni Xin, under the care and leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Health Commission, and Municipal Hospital Administration Party Committee, the hospital actively cultivates and practices socialist core values, emphasizing the guiding role of hospital culture. This has produced outstanding examples such as Jia Liqun, Director of the Ultrasound Department at Beijing Children's Hospital, who has diagnosed over 70,000 cases of rare pediatric diseases and saved more than 2,000 critically ill children; and Qian Suyun, Director of the Intensive Care Medicine Department at Beijing Children's Hospital, who has participated in emergency treatment of critically ill children in public health emergencies nationwide more than 10 times, pioneered cerebral blood flow monitoring research for critically ill children domestically, and proposed transcranial Doppler diagnostic criteria for pediatric brain death, filling a gap in domestic pediatrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Party Committee of Beijing Children's Hospital earnestly implements the spirit of the National Health and Wellness Conference, manages three maternal and child hospitals in Shunyi, Baoding, and Zhengzhou, promotes a \"patients stay, doctors travel\" treatment model, achieves shared expert resources, and benefits local patients. Beijing Children's Hospital has also fully implemented modern hospital management systems, continuously promoting pediatric medical development, and has successively received multiple honorary titles including National Civilized Unit, National Advanced Primary Party Organization for Excellence Creation, and Beijing Outstanding Unit for Ideological and Political Work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ni Xin stated that Beijing Children's Hospital will use this event as an opportunity to work on \"entering the mind, heart, and actions\" and focus efforts on \"implementing in detail, small steps, and practice,\" truly internalizing values and externalizing behaviors, putting socialist core values into practice. Using the hospital's reform and development and the construction of the National Children's Medical Center as opportunities, it will lead China's pediatric medical field to new heights.\n",

      "Previously, Zhao was arrested in the United States on suspicion of violating anti-money laundering laws. Documents submitted by prosecutors to the court showed that Zhao's crimes warranted a 36-month prison sentence.

      "**Economic Measures Are Necessary and Effective**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearing follower counts, suspending or closing live streaming, user rewards, paid knowledge services, and revenue withdrawal privileges, removing product links, canceling advertising revenue and traffic sharing... The Cyberspace Administration of China announced that starting March 12, as part of the 2023 \"Clear and Bright\" series of special action plans, it will launch a two-month special campaign called \"Clear and Bright: Strictly Regulating 'Self-Media' Chaos.\" A major highlight of this campaign is guiding website platforms to use economic measures to severely crack down on \"self-media\" accounts that profit through illegal and irregular means. These root-and-branch disposal methods once again demonstrate the Cyberspace Administration's determination to clean up problematic accounts and create a clear cyberspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, self-media has flourished, bringing richer and more interesting content to internet users; self-media practitioners have also seized opportunities for low-barrier employment and entrepreneurship to realize their self-worth. Regrettably, accompanying this new communication ecosystem has been a chaotic mix of good and bad. Manufacturing rumors, distorting truth, and malicious hype are common tactics used by many self-media accounts. There are those who piggyback on public policies with distorted interpretations, fabricate false scenarios to incite antagonistic emotions, and impersonate party, government, military organizations, public institutions, and news media to publish fake news. There are also those who make biased comments with selective quotations, plagiarize original content, and defraud netizen donations... For example, in recent days, a \"legendary academic genius\" played with traffic, claiming to have been admitted to Tsinghua University (which he didn't like) and then dropped out to get into Peking University, garnering over 500,000 likes from netizens. However, sharp-eyed netizens pointed out this was merely a trick involving stolen images and lies. Such self-media rumors not only cause great distress to the parties involved but also damage government credibility; they disrupt internet order and create chaos in social order. Chasing hot topics, harvesting traffic, gaining followers, and monetizing have become the business logic of such self-media.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the state has continuously improved institutional mechanisms and upgraded technical means to combat self-media chaos. The persistence of self-media chaos has two main causes: first, adhering to \"economic interests above all,\" disregarding public morality and law for the sake of traffic monetization; second, some platforms turn a blind eye to problematic accounts, setting rules on one hand while being reluctant to seriously enforce them on the other. Ultimately, in the eyes of certain self-media and operators, truth, rationality, civility, rules, values, and so forth are far less important than the word \"traffic\" - because behind traffic lies the irresistible lure of real money.\n",
      "\n",
      "To eradicate the problem of self-media irregular operations fraudulently gaining traffic, economic measures are undoubtedly the most direct and effective approach. This special campaign has established specific penalty provisions at a higher level for \"self-media lack of self-discipline,\" such as clearing massive follower counts obtained through deception, closing account holders' withdrawal privileges, and canceling advertising revenue and traffic sharing. Like removing fuel from under a cauldron, this directly cuts off the financial channels for accounts to continue causing trouble, delivering the most painful punishment to those who repeatedly ignore advice and have no bottom line. We expect all platforms to strictly implement these measures, proactively assume responsibility, and strictly follow regulations, no longer giving self-media opportunities to cause trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike the snake at its vital point. For self-media accounts that write recklessly, spray abuse, and ignore public order, good customs, and laws, only by leaving them empty-handed in terms of both traffic and money can we truly curb their wild and disorderly growth, creating a clearer cyberspace.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the afternoon of September 25 local time, early morning today (September 26) Beijing time, the UN Security Council held an emergency review of the Lebanon-Israel situation. China's Permanent Representative to the UN, Fu Cong, stated in his remarks that China expresses serious concern over the current Lebanon-Israel situation, firmly supports Lebanon in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and national dignity, and strongly condemns acts that violate basic principles of international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "China firmly opposes any indiscriminate attacks against civilians that cross the red lines of international humanitarian law, emphasizes the importance of effectively ensuring the safety of UN peacekeeping personnel, and stresses that UN personnel and assets cannot become targets of armed attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fu Cong stated that since the Gaza conflict erupted in October last year, the focus of all international efforts has been to promote an immediate ceasefire and prevent the conflict from spilling over and expanding. However, the reality is developing in the opposite direction. Just as world leaders gather in New York and issue an overwhelming call for maintaining Middle East peace in the UN General Assembly debate, Israel chooses to expand military operations at this time, which is nothing short of a mockery of international justice and the authority of international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fu Cong emphasized that the Middle East region cannot afford a new war. The urgent priority is to stop military adventurism and promote de-escalation of the situation. China urges the Israeli side to make the right decision, abandon its obsession with the use of force, stop military operations in Gaza, stop acts that violate Lebanon's sovereignty and security, and stop adventurous actions that could drag the region into a new catastrophe. China also calls on all relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid actions that aggravate tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fu Cong said the Security Council bears the important responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Under current circumstances, the vast majority of Security Council members support the Security Council taking urgent action to make efforts to prevent deterioration of the situation. China expects all Security Council members to demonstrate political will and leadership in maintaining peace, respond to the expectations of Lebanon and Arab countries, and support the Security Council in taking necessary and forceful action as soon as possible to play a practical role in stopping war and easing the situation.\n",

      "Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who is visiting the UK, delivered a speech at a local dinner, pointing out that the Hong Kong National Security Law has consolidated the confidence of international investors, and welcomed British enterprises and investors to come to Hong Kong to participate in development projects and jointly explore business opportunities. About 400 local political and business figures attended this event, including former Governor David Wilson and former Chief Secretary Lydia Dunn, who are familiar to Hong Kong people. This fact shows that British society hopes to understand Hong Kong's current situation and, more importantly, hopes to share the opportunities and achievements of mainland China's economic development through Hong Kong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between Hong Kong and the UK cannot be generalized. On one hand, some British politicians harbor hostility toward China and the Hong Kong SAR, doing their utmost to smear the National Security Law and depicting Hong Kong's current situation as a complete mess. The troublemakers who have fled to the UK cannot bear to see relations between the two places improve, advocating boycotts and sanctions against Hong Kong SAR officials, and harassing SAR officials visiting there. On the other hand, there are also rational voices in British society, particularly in the business community, which does not want to lose the \"goose that lays golden eggs\" that is the Hong Kong market. They urgently need to understand what has happened in Hong Kong, what the current situation actually is, and what the investment environment is like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK's contradictory attitude toward Hong Kong is quite representative in European and American societies. Three years of pandemic prevention measures have increased the sense of alienation between both sides. The SAR government sending officials to visit Europe and speak from personal experience has strong persuasive power, helping to dispel various rumors, alleviate unnecessary fears about the Hong Kong National Security Law in local society, and promote cooperation between the two places. Although Hong Kong officials may face unfriendly treatment locally, including being shouted at and harassed by those with ulterior motives, the Hong Kong SAR cannot retreat because of this, but must have the courage to \"head toward Tiger Mountain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Chan is the highest-ranking SAR government official to visit Europe post-pandemic, with over 100 business people accompanying the delegation, a scale rarely seen in recent years. This European trip covers the three most important European countries. The first stop in France attracted over a thousand local political and business celebrities; the response at the second stop in the UK has also been good; the next stop is Germany, which is even more anticipated.\n",

      "I opened my stock account in late March 2014. From then until the last few days of June 2018, for approximately 4 years and 3 months, my investment style was the \"ivory tower\" model. As the name suggests, I used the most direct knowledge from university textbooks to select stocks, unlike later when I adjusted traditional indicators, such as emphasizing non-recurring profits and operating cash flow, using the ratio of cash minus interest-bearing liabilities to market value to assess traditional companies' undervaluation index, and differentiating the degree to which minority shareholder equity bullies listed company shareholders, including the erosion of business models by related-party transactions and abnormal advertising expenses... Later in my papers, I was also among the early advocates of using market-to-R&D ratio to value and price technology companies without scale revenue. At that time, the quality of listed companies was clear-cut. You didn't need profound knowledge of accounting and finance to spot the gems with the naked eye. In 2014, there were fewer than 3,000 listed companies, with trading suspensions and \"black five categories\" accounting for almost one-third. I can say I was particularly lucky with my market entry timing, to the point where I doubted my own eyes - whatever you bought went up. It reached the level where you could buy with your eyes closed and everything would rise. Later, as the old village chief who \"raided the widow's village\" brought a pile of problematic companies to market in a Great Leap Forward style, these companies still give the A-share market indigestion today. Due to the increase in the number of listed companies, especially new economic models and products that break through traditional concepts, the quality distinction among listed companies is no longer so clear-cut. Especially with the major regression in information disclosure and cloudy, vague language, the ivory tower model completely failed. I remember being tormented by Vanke's long-term trading suspension, which is why I've never liked Vanke's management. Later, Hisense Kelon and China Environment (before its mixed-ownership reform) tormented me for a year and a half, making me reflect on my past stock selection methods. This is also why I repeatedly bought and sold Hisense Kelon shares later - I wanted to earn back the wasted time costs. China Environment later brought me unexpected success. My stock selection model changed in 2018, when daily trading volume sometimes dropped to less than 240 billion yuan, and the market was on the verge of liquidity exhaustion. The turning point came in the last few days of June 2018, and from then on, my style changed completely. I no longer pursued step-by-step approaches, and the ivory tower model completely collapsed. In the last few days of June, ZTE, which was subject to \"suffocating\" remarks, hit eight consecutive daily limit downs, with its market value once falling to 60 billion yuan due to sanctions, causing market uproar. That was the first time I was so bold in bottom-fishing. Those who later understood my style thought I liked \"eating melons\" (watching drama), but actually it was my grandfather who liked eating melons. Starting from the end of June, my stock selection model changed completely, focusing on non-operating events that severely hit listed company stock prices - that is, unexpected disasters, including mistakes by actual controllers, directors, supervisors, and senior executives, and safety accidents - these three main areas of mistakes would bring market mistakes. Although many people think the market doesn't make mistakes, in reality entire eras can make mistakes, entire eras can wrong certain individuals or groups, let alone markets backed by divergent group behavior. We easily read a few investment master books and then use others' brains to think about our own lives and investment directions and behaviors. The direct consequence of market mistakes is stock price crashes. After crashes, all my enthusiasm tilted toward: \"Buy on the operating table, sell at discharge.\" Later came New City Holdings with its actual controller's child molestation case, ST Jiannanchun's failed restructuring with gritted teeth, Shanghai Electric's special communications president's suicide, ST Kehua's public WeChat conflict between minority shareholders represented by three PhDs and Lu Si's uncle... When these unexpected disasters struck, stock prices were severely hit. And their financial statements weren't shattered at all - even in the worst cases, the statements remained safe. Now, without unexpected disasters, current valuation levels have basically returned to the state of March 2014. Numerous listed companies are ridiculously undervalued, with the ratio of (cash-like assets - interest-bearing liabilities)/market value for many companies falling between 0.8-1.2. After experiencing A-share market hits, investors should understand that the enemy of this market has never been foreign capital that Banxia Li Bei, wearing lipstick, accuses of being troublemakers. Everyone knows deep down that if NASDAQ were managed by the CSRC and CICC, they would also govern it into a situation of no growth for decades.\n",

      "Our newspaper reports (Reporter Xu Yisheng) After nearly 5 months of renovation, the Shanghai Library Huaihai Road Branch has completed its service layout transformation and reopened today. As the Shanghai Library East Branch increasingly resembles a \"reading-cultural center,\" the Huaihai Road Branch has repositioned itself as a \"reading-learning center,\" with three service lines—document borrowing, professional services, and knowledge discovery—redefining the professional character of the Huaihai Road Branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shanghai Library currently holds 57 million volumes/items in its collection, most of which can be accessed at the Huaihai Road Branch. Readers can obtain documents or consult librarians in different service areas according to their needs. In terms of professional services, the Huaihai Road Branch caters to research needs and can provide multiple professional and stable solutions. For example, despite being closed for extended periods over the past year, interlibrary lending and document delivery services still completed nearly 40,000 articles/volumes, while newspaper clipping services continuously provided nearly 4,000 issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an important component of building an internet-based physical library, Shanghai Library provides readers with vast digital resource search and download services. Through professional service portals, over the past year, an average of more than 86,000 readers per day accessed related services. Meanwhile, the \"Find Documents at Shanghai Library\" WeChat account, aimed at knowledge sharing, has also received significant attention and recognition from users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reopened Huaihai Road Branch's first floor serves as the reference borrowing area, consisting of a comprehensive reading room, reference book room, study rooms, archival document reading room, Little Pigeon Knowledge Navigation Station, and others, providing reference document borrowing services with 410 seats. The second floor is the general borrowing area, composed of the science and technology book room, social sciences book room, and newspaper and magazine room, providing \"one-card\" Chinese book and periodical borrowing and newspaper reading services with 254 seats. The third floor is the periodical reading/document service area, consisting of Chinese science and technology periodical reading room, Chinese social sciences periodical reading room, foreign science and technology periodical reading room, foreign social sciences periodical reading room, research service station, special document service point, and others, providing Chinese and foreign periodical and special document reading services and personalized document services with 345 seats. The fourth floor is a temporary office area and is not open to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this reopening, the Huaihai Road Branch will implement a Sunday closure policy to stagger maintenance with the East Branch, which closes on Mondays, ensuring that readers can visit at least one Shanghai Library branch every day. The Huaihai Road Branch's daily opening hours will also be synchronized with the East Branch, set at 9 AM.\n",

      "Among the world's 16 oldest companies, five are alcohol companies. Why have these businesses been able to survive for so long? I think it's the business model. Look at Moutai - it has a gross profit margin as high as 90%. On average, it takes three jin of grain to brew one jin of baijiu, and one jin of baijiu can sell for over a thousand yuan. This is why alcohol companies have been able to survive for such a long time. Guizhou Moutai's performance growth has two aspects: on one hand, product price increases! On the other hand, production expansion! Product price increases are not a privilege that any product has, but Guizhou Moutai is a special case. In 1956, a bottle of Guizhou Moutai cost about 2.68 yuan, but now a bottle of Guizhou Moutai costs over 2,000 yuan - a price increase of over a hundredfold. Guizhou Moutai is a scarce product with supply falling short of demand. The company only needs to appropriately expand production capacity, and market demand will drive it up - so how could performance not rise? Therefore, the reason why baijiu companies led by Guizhou Moutai have seen their stock prices soar over the past few decades is ultimately because of their business model: light asset investment, high return rates, and extremely high corporate moats.\n",

      "\n",
      "If one hadn't seen it with their own eyes, it would be hard to believe that this lean-faced, somewhat shy post-90s young man is engaged in heavy cargo delivery work at a logistics company. One person, one vehicle, one order, one responsibility - in this demanding industry with high staff turnover, Chen Shouchen has been working for 7 years, maintaining zero complaints and zero errors throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the delivery route, Chen Shouchen counted his day's work, \"A total of 36 orders, involving 24 residential communities, 5 shopping malls, and 7 factories, with everything from furniture and home appliances to auto parts.\" Despite the heavy workload, Chen Shouchen's tone was full of sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transitioning from an armored soldier to a heavy cargo courier, while his position changed, his original intention remained unchanged. \"The military taught me responsibility and perseverance. I used to be a 'soldier' protecting the country and home, now I'm a 'soldier' serving the people,\" Chen Shouchen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about 20 minutes, Chen Shouchen arrived at his first delivery point, carrying a 1.8m × 2m mattress. After communicating with the customer again, he skillfully took out a rope, wrapped it around the mattress in a cross pattern, and securely strapped it to his back. \"This is an old residential complex without elevators, and the customer lives on the 3rd floor, so I have to carry it up,\" he said while walking toward the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Youth is meant for struggle!\" In Chen Shouchen's view, logistics delivery is an important part of economic and social development, so his work is very meaningful. \"A little hardship and fatigue is nothing. Every time I personally deliver large items and see customers' satisfied smiles, I feel it's all worth it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about his current life, Chen Shouchen is very content. \"Love what you do, specialize in what you do. After several years of struggle, I've bought a house and car, and have established myself in Dalian. Especially in recent years, the Party and government have paid increasing attention to new employment groups, and social work departments have introduced many good policies. Combined with care from all sectors of society, I feel warm in my heart every day and full of energy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This love is also a two-way journey. During deliveries, he casually photographs damaged manhole covers and fire hazards; during breaks, he assists communities in promoting anti-fraud knowledge and participates in volunteer services. Chen Shouchen actively participates in grassroots social governance through these \"small efforts.\" At the end of 2021, Chen Shouchen was elected as a member of the Dalian CPPCC. He focused on industry pain points, combined with daily observations, and continuously submitted multiple proposals to speak up for new employment groups.\n",

      "Each stage indeed brings different confusions. Recently, I've met with several peers of my age, and after hearing their struggles, I realized my own confusion can only be considered trivial complaints at best - mostly issues of unfocused energy due to pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously, leading to reduced operational efficiency in the business. I've been contemplating the allocation of energy between future investments and actual business operations for some time now. It's now clear that I must persist in running the business well - full-time investing really doesn't offer much to do, and leaving the actual business would eliminate many informational advantages. For instance, being in e-commerce gives me deep understanding of platform changes; the latest platform developments, whether it's Pinduoduo's short videos or Taobao's increased commissions, team work reports, and peer exchanges all serve as information sources for investment decisions. Being in the liquor business means daily communication with many suppliers, providing relatively timely market intelligence; even when occasionally playing with swing trading, the success rate remains very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The confusion is essentially a management issue. Without regular follow-up with the team, they tend to become slack, and once slack sets in, tightening up becomes harder than climbing to heaven. If the boss himself is busy stealing moments of laziness, what more can be expected from the team? Moreover, business operations are interconnected - when one link has problems, a chain of issues emerges. In the past two years, I haven't managed the supply chain much, and the team's sense of rhythm has obviously weakened. Each person's inherent traits determine what they excel at, and my role remains crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US startup plan has been steadily progressing, but it's still constrained by energy allocation. Simply providing product supply chain and operational philosophy isn't sufficient to support business expansion. Currently, while it's not losing money, if I don't participate end-to-end, slightly increasing investment would return us to the 2021 situation. If I go all the way through the entire process, there would definitely be no problem, but energy would be consumed limitlessly.\n",

      "Pure investment is now very stable in terms of profitability. After two years of testing, incorporating entrepreneurial thinking into the investment system can fully support various short, medium, and long-term strategies.

      "Currently, I need to improve team communication and feedback. Given the characteristics of the northern team, work content and standards need to be repeatedly clarified, and external changes need to be repeatedly emphasized. The team has no problem with internal operations and execution, but communication at the management or business level and resource allocation still require partners.\n",

      "After graduating from university, Lu Ruijin chose to join the military in Tibet.

Recently, the \"Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Learning from and Applying the Experience of the 'Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation' Project to Effectively Promote Comprehensive Rural Revitalization\" was released. This is the 12th Central Document No. 1 guiding \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, once again sending a strong signal of prioritizing and strengthening agriculture, and pointing out the direction and practical path for promoting comprehensive rural revitalization and accelerating the construction of an agricultural powerhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agriculture is the foundation of the world.\" Over the past year, facing complex domestic and international situations, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we overcame multiple adverse impacts including relatively severe natural disasters, achieved \"twenty consecutive years of bumper harvests\" in grain production with output reaching a new historical high, saw relatively rapid growth in farmers' income, and maintained rural social harmony and stability, providing strong support for promoting economic recovery and improvement, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, and focusing on high-quality development. In comprehensively building a modern socialist country, the most arduous and onerous tasks still lie in rural areas. To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must persistently consolidate the agricultural foundation and promote comprehensive rural revitalization. In doing a good job in \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work in the new era and new journey, we should take promoting comprehensive rural revitalization as the overall starting point, adhere to people-centered development thinking, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, fight a beautiful battle for comprehensive rural revitalization, paint a new picture of livable, workable, and beautiful rural areas, and better advance Chinese-style modernization through accelerated agricultural and rural modernization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we should take learning from and applying the experience of the \"Million Project\" as our guide. When General Secretary Xi Jinping worked in Zhejiang, he personally planned and promoted the \"Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation\" project. Through more than 20 years of continuous efforts, it has not only profoundly changed the overall appearance of Zhejiang's rural areas but also made pioneering explorations and demonstrated the way for promoting comprehensive rural revitalization, which can be learned from and referenced by all regions. We should learn from and apply the development concepts, working methods, and promotion mechanisms contained in the \"Million Project,\" start from practical problems strongly reflected by farmers and the masses, find the entry point for rural revitalization, adapt to local conditions, seek practical results, and concentrate efforts on accomplishing a batch of practical matters that the masses can perceive and benefit from.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we must firmly hold two bottom lines: ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale return to poverty. Having grain in hand brings peace of mind. To ensure national food security, we must persist in stabilizing acreage and increasing per-unit yield, effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers for grain production and localities for grain management, earnestly focus on grain and important agricultural product production, solidly advance the new round of action to increase grain production capacity by 100 billion jin, improve the \"trinity\" protection system for cultivated land quantity, quality, and ecology, ensure grain output remains above 1.3 trillion jin, build a diversified food supply system, and further secure and stabilize China's rice bowl. We must implement the monitoring and assistance mechanism to prevent return to poverty, tighten responsibilities for preventing return to poverty, continue to strengthen industrial and employment assistance, increase support for key regions, improve development conditions, enhance \"blood-making\" capabilities, stimulate endogenous motivation, continuously consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, and ensure no large-scale return to poverty occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we must focus on key tasks such as improving rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance levels and continue to exert efforts. Rural areas are not only spatial carriers for agricultural production but also the homeland where vast numbers of farmers are born and raised. We must improve the level of rural industrial development, promote the integrated development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, do a good job with \"local specialties,\" persist in revitalizing agriculture through industry, quality, and green development, and accelerate the construction of a modern rural industrial system that combines agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, integrates production, processing, and sales, and merges agriculture, culture, and tourism. We must improve the level of rural construction, enhance the guiding effectiveness of rural planning, adapt to trends in rural population changes, optimize village layout, industrial structure, and public service allocation, and coordinate new urbanization with comprehensive rural revitalization. We must improve the level of rural governance, promote rural revitalization through Party building, prosper and develop rural culture, continue to promote rural customs reform, persist in and develop the \"Fengqiao Experience\" in the new era, and build peaceful rural areas. By coordinating the promotion of rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance, and continuously creating a good environment for living and working in peace and contentment, we can give vast numbers of farmers a more substantial sense of gain, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, technology is a powerful tool and reform is a magic weapon. We must strengthen the dual-wheel drive of technology and reform, optimize the strategic layout of agricultural technological innovation, increase efforts to tackle key core technologies in seed resources, strengthen rural reform and innovation, strengthen the integrated effectiveness of reform measures, and add momentum and vitality to comprehensive rural revitalization. \"Good governance in the world lies in the prosperity of the people.\" Increasing farmers' income is the central task of \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work. We must implement actions to promote farmers' income increase, continue to strengthen rural industries that enrich the people, strengthen the connection between industrial development and farmers, strengthen vocational skills training for migrant workers, promote multi-channel employment for rural labor, widely open income-increasing channels, and make farmers' purses fuller and their lives better.\n",

      "Some martial arts novels describe a grand conspiracy to destroy the entire martial arts world, or a so-called madman who intends to challenge the entire martial arts community, but ultimately a young hero or grandmaster will appear to solve the so-called problem and defend the orthodox martial arts tradition. Now a modern version of this script is being played out. Xu Xiaodong, a previously not-so-famous \"martial artist,\" has become a current celebrity, one who challenges the entire \"martial arts world\" - such boldness, how many people throughout history could match it? Though the hype is high, most of it is just verbal sparring. There has been only one real match, lasting just a few dozen seconds, in which Xu Xiaodong KO'd a \"Tai Chi master.\" The reason Xu Xiaodong is so popular is not because his fists are hard, but because his slogan is catchy - \"exposing fake martial arts.\" Is Xu Xiaodong really a \"fraud-fighting warrior\"? Perhaps not entirely. Whether it's gaining fans or creating hype, his real intention is still to promote MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), which is why he also challenges the warrior monk Yi Long and provokes Zou Shiming. Zou Shiming is not some traditional martial arts master - his championship belt is absolutely genuine. Yi Long, though called a warrior monk, actually incorporates many modern fighting techniques. Even so, Xu Xiaodong still receives support from many people, because this so-called \"martial arts world\" is too fake and needs someone like Xu Xiaodong to clean it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese people have a deep \"martial arts worship\" complex, just like Americans have hero worship. But American hero worship has been constantly evolving, as can be seen from their film and television works - from the quick-draw Western films of the past, to the Rambo-style lone heroes later on, to today's Marvel superheroes. With technological advancement, their worship has kept pace with the times. But in Chinese cinema, martial arts films endure, only becoming increasingly fantastical. The reason is that traditional Chinese martial arts have always maintained a sense of mystery - simply put, there are always people who believe in the existence of reclusive masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's undeniable that with technological development and progress, traditional martial arts inevitably decline and transform. Xu Haofeng, director of \"The Master,\" also described this process in his book \"The Vanished Martial Arts World.\" But many people are still intoxicated by that kind of martial arts that involves scaling walls and striking cattle from a distance, which is why \"martial arts fraudsters\" continue to emerge even today. Those qigong masters and sect leaders flourish - whether they're fake or not doesn't matter, as long as they have beds of white jade and horses of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to many such masters, Xu Xiaodong is hardly worth mentioning, but if he can tear away those facades and let more people see what real traditional martial arts are, wouldn't that be a good thing? What Xu Xiaodong is fighting is not traditional martial arts, but the false signs within traditional martial arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, even if Xu Xiaodong defeats all those masters, or if no one dares to accept his challenges, this doesn't mean traditional martial arts lose their reason to exist. As long as they are legitimate and authentic, they will continue to develop. After all, no matter how powerful MMA and Xu Xiaodong are, there are far more people practicing Tai Chi in parks than practicing combat sports in martial arts gyms.\n",

      "Gasgoo News: According to reports, on August 23, Kevin Gotinsky, the United Auto Workers (UAW) official responsible for Stellantis, called for the resignation of the company's CEO Carlos Tavares and stated that he does not believe the company's claim that contractual terms allow Stellantis to delay the reopening plan for the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to reporters after a union rally at the Belvidere Assembly Plant, Gotinsky said: \"I think he (Tavares) either needs to leave, or find people around him to help manage the company with him, because I don't think he knows what he's doing.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Gotinsky's remarks align completely with UAW President Shawn Fain, who also attacked Tavares in a video released on August 16, saying: \"Now is the time to make changes, and change starts from the top.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The UAW has criticized Tavares' handling of recent layoffs and threatened to organize strikes against the company for failing to fulfill its commitment to reopen the idle Belvidere plant by 2027. Stellantis has acknowledged plans to delay the factory reopening.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a memo Stellantis sent to employees, the company cited Article 311 of the contract, stating that product investment and employment levels \"depend on plant performance, changes in market conditions, and whether consumer demand can continue to provide sustainable and profitable production for all the aforementioned U.S. manufacturing plants.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stellantis told employees in the memo that strikes are illegal and the company will \"challenge such actions through all available legal channels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Gotinsky said on August 23 that the UAW does not agree with this interpretation. He told reporters: \"We've been meeting about these situations for months, but they never mentioned market conditions. In certain circumstances, we can obviously have conversations about changing investments, but this was never discussed between both parties. If the situation is really as bad as they claim, how can he (Tavares) give himself a raise? Our contract expires in May 2028, but they want to delay it to Q4 2028, so they're trying to completely escape their commitments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Union leaders attending the rally also noted that Tavares initially indicated he would go to the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant but then failed to show up. UAW Local 1700 President Michael Spencer, representing workers at that plant, said he received a last-minute invitation to meet with Tavares, but as of the afternoon of August 23, he had not received a response regarding details.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Stellantis spokesperson said in a statement: \"We are conducting progress assessments as planned. We appreciate the significant progress the (Sterling Heights Assembly Plant) team has made over the past few months.\" On the evening of August 22, foreign media spotted Tavares conversing with Stellantis Chairman John Elkann at a restaurant in the Detroit suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gotinsky said that despite escalating tensions between both sides, dialogue continues. He said: \"Communication is still ongoing. They clearly know what we think, but unfortunately, their senior leadership has other plans. We will work hard to get him to do the right thing.\"\n",

      "Xinhua News Agency Special Report: U.S. Secretary of State Blinken met with foreign ministers from multiple Arab countries on November 4, continuing to reject calls for a Gaza ceasefire and only advocating for a temporary humanitarian pause. Palestinian President Abbas called for an immediate end to the conflict when he met with Blinken in Ramallah on the 5th, stating that Israel bears full responsibility for the current situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli forces conducted airstrikes on a refugee camp and a UN-established school in the Gaza Strip on the 4th, killing dozens of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the same day, citizens in the United States, Germany, Britain, France and other countries held rallies and marches demanding that Israeli forces halt military operations in Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blinken discussed the Israeli-Palestinian situation with the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in Amman, Jordan's capital, on the 4th. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Israeli military actions are \"completely not legitimate self-defense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Palestinian President Abbas met with Blinken in Ramallah, a West Bank city, on the 5th, calling for an immediate end to the \"devastating conflict\" and accelerated delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including medical supplies, food, water, electricity and fuel. Abbas stated that Israel bears full responsibility for the current situation and emphasized that military means will not bring security to Israel - peace can only be achieved by ending Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blinken expressed that the United States firmly supports Israel's right to self-defense, saying a ceasefire would only give Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement that controls Gaza, an opportunity to regroup and attack Israel again. He reiterated the U.S. position of advocating for Israeli forces to temporarily cease fire and implement a so-called \"humanitarian pause\" to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and foreign nationals to evacuate, while still \"achieving the goal of defeating Hamas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when Blinken visited Israel the previous day, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected this proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked by media reporters on the 4th whether U.S. efforts to promote a \"humanitarian pause\" were making progress, President Biden only answered \"yes\" with a thumbs up, without revealing more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blinken's trip also attempted to discuss future arrangements for Gaza if Israel defeats Hamas. But Arab foreign ministers responded that the immediate priority is a ceasefire and providing humanitarian aid. \"How can we possibly consider the future now?\" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Safadi. \"We must deal with priorities.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "The number of patients with ophthalmic diseases is increasing, with dry eye syndrome and myopia affecting many patient populations in China. At the beginning of this year, the popular drama \"The Knockout\" featured the character Gao Qiqiang being diagnosed with dry eye syndrome, which helped more people become familiar with this disease. Although dry eye syndrome doesn't sound like a frightening \"terminal illness,\" this condition not only negatively impacts patients' quality of life but can even lead to permanent vision damage, and should not be taken lightly. It is estimated that by 2030, the domestic dry eye syndrome drug market will grow significantly to $6.7 billion, showing broad market prospects and enormous drug demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry eye syndrome is a diagnosed disease caused by reduced tear secretion or excessive tear evaporation that results in eye dryness, and there are multiple therapeutic drugs available. Artificial tears are the most commonly used and fundamental dry eye eye drops. With technological development, safer and more effective cyclosporine drugs are receiving increasing attention. Many domestic pharmaceutical companies are joining the cyclosporine dry eye drug market through introduction, generic production, or independent research and development, with Xingqi Pharmaceutical's Zirun being the first cyclosporine generic drug launched domestically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, many new mechanism dry eye drugs are being developed clinically, including perfluorohexyloctane Miebo launched in May this year, TRPM8 agonist AR-15512 in Phase III clinical trials, and new-generation LFA-1 antagonist VVN-001 in Phase II clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Large Market Scale with Rapid Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the proliferation of electronic devices and increased aging, the incidence of ophthalmic diseases is rising. Eye diseases mainly include ocular inflammation, glaucoma, cataracts, visual fatigue, myopia, and dry eye syndrome, with refractive errors and dry eye syndrome having the largest patient populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry eye syndrome, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a diagnosed disease of eye dryness caused by reduced tear secretion or excessive tear evaporation. There are multiple causes, such as excessive dependence on electronic devices, air pollution, long-term eye makeup use, contact lens wearing, and vitamin A deficiency leading to eye dryness.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from the \"Multi-center Big Data Report on Dry Eye in Chinese People,\" China currently has approximately 360 million dry eye patients, with a potential annual increase of 10%. The incidence rate among frequent video terminal users is as high as 93%, and among contact lens wearers it reaches 90%. Dry eye is becoming another national eye health issue following myopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ophthalmology has strong technical barriers, with higher penetration rates abroad. In recent years, with increased attention, the ophthalmology field has developed rapidly, and the domestic dry eye drug market size has gradually expanded. It is projected that by 2030, the dry eye drug market will grow significantly at a compound annual growth rate of 28.4% to $6.7 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Classification and Overview of Therapeutic Drugs\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry eye treatment methods mainly include drug therapy and non-drug therapy. Dry eye therapeutic drugs can be divided into three categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Artificial tears and secretagogues, which can lubricate the ocular surface and promote repair;\n",
      "2. Antimicrobial drugs, targeting infection-related or lipid abnormality-type dry eye;\n",
      "3. Anti-inflammatory drugs, targeting the core pathological inflammatory mechanisms of dry eye [1].\n",

      "\n",
      "NO.1 Artificial Tears\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial tears have become fundamental medications for dry eye treatment, serving as a substitute for human tears. They are typically water-soluble high molecular polymers that, when applied topically to the eyes, provide soothing and lubricating effects on the eye mucosa, thereby relieving dry eye symptoms. They come in both eye drop and eye ointment forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main artificial tears in the domestic market include sodium hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid, and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations. Among these, sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic preparations are currently the largest-selling dry eye drops in the hospital market, with a market share exceeding 25%, followed by hyaluronic acid ophthalmic preparations and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations, accounting for approximately 25.8% and 25.6% respectively. However, in recent years, sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid have shown declining hospital sales, while recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations like Yisheng Bio's Beifushu have shown an upward trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, artificial tears available on the domestic market include: SYSTANE® ULTRA (Siran), Refresh plus (Liangshi), Aili, Runjie, Runshu, Beifushu (containing recombinant human fibroblast growth factor), Leiran, and Taisho Pharmaceutical's Alice artificial tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial tears differ from naturally produced tears, and most artificial tear drops contain preservatives. Frequent and regular use can damage the cornea, so it's best to use them under medical guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "NO.2 Immunosuppressants (Cyclosporine Eye Drops)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyclosporine eye drops have extensive applications in ophthalmology, but different concentrations serve different purposes. Currently, there are three main cyclosporine eye drop products on the domestic market:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 1% cyclosporine eye drops (3 mL:30 mg) mainly used for preventing and treating immune rejection after corneal transplantation;\n",
      "2. 0.1% cyclosporine eye drops (III) (0.3 mL:0.3 mg) mainly used for treating severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children and adolescents aged 4 and above;\n",
      "3. 0.05% cyclosporine eye drops (II) (0.4 mL:0.2 mg) mainly used for dry eye patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyclosporine eye drops are currently the most effective drugs for treating dry eye and have become the best-selling products in the US dry eye field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple cyclosporine eye drops have been approved globally, such as Allergan's Restasis 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion, Sun Pharma's Cequa 0.09% nanomicellar solution, and Santen's Ikervis 0.1% cationic emulsion preparation (Figure 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides original new drugs, many cyclosporine generics have been approved globally, such as Mylan's 0.05% cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion and the first approved domestic product, Xingqi Eye Pharmaceutical's Class III generic 0.05% cyclosporine eye drops (Zirun) (Figure 2).\n",

      "The International Meat Industry Expo is a cooperation and exchange platform for the meat industry that China has created, based in western China, covering the whole country, and having international influence. Yinchuan has excellent agricultural and livestock industry foundations, conditions, and prospects. As an important production base for high-quality beef and mutton nationwide, it raises 252,000 head of beef cattle, accounting for 11.2% of the entire region, and 2.128 million Tan sheep, accounting for 15% of the entire region. The beef and mutton produced have delicious taste and rich nutrition, making them the \"leading sheep\" and \"pioneering cattle\" of Ningxia's meat industry. The unique resource advantages have made Yinchuan an important national production base for high-quality beef and mutton.\n",

In 2022, it achieved a regional GDP of 77.558 billion yuan, ranking first among Ningxia's counties and districts, and has been listed among \"China's Top 100 Counties in Comprehensive Strength\" for 10 consecutive years. It is the only city in Ningxia selected for the 2022 National County Development Potential List and China's Top 100 Industrial Counties (Cities). The territory is rich in coal, oil, gas and other resources, making it a nationally important coal-electricity-chemical base, cashmere industry base, urban mineral demonstration base, high-quality grain processing base, and mutton production and processing base. At the exhibition site, the Lingwu Pavilion set up four exhibition areas for meat, dairy products, grain and oil, and fruits and vegetables, selecting meat enterprises and characteristic product enterprises from the jurisdiction to participate, showcasing the development characteristics of Lingwu's meat, dairy, grain and oil food, and fruit and vegetable industries, accelerating the construction of Lingwu's agricultural product production-sales integration mechanism, improving Lingwu's industrial chain and supply chain level, enriching Lingwu's meat product supply, and fully stimulating Lingwu's consumption momentum.

Zhu Ling learned that Pan was already pregnant when she and her husband divorced through mediation, and after the marriage she gave birth to a son and raised him alone until he was 18 years old. Subsequently, Pan filed a lawsuit in court, demanding that her ex-husband pay child support from the time of the child's birth. After hearing the case, the court ruled that since Pan's son was already an adult, it only supported child support for the two years prior to the date of filing the lawsuit.\n",

      "After carefully reviewing the case files, Zhu Ling believed that the focal point of the case dispute was how to apply the statute of limitations to claims for child support when the maintenance relationship no longer existed. Faced with the thorny problem of different interpretations of the statute of limitations, Zhu Ling consulted extensive materials and, starting from the legislative intent, comprehensively articulated the viewpoint that \"if the person being supported is already 18 years old and no longer meets the conditions for being supported, and requests payment of support fees before the age of 18, the statute of limitations should be calculated from the date when the conditions for support are no longer met.\" This viewpoint was recognized by higher-level procuratorial authorities. Later, following the procuratorate's protest, the court reopened the case and adopted the protest opinion.\n",

      "Global long-term investors' views on the mainland stock market have begun to shift: outflows from mainland stocks slowed at the end of February, with regional active fund managers starting to increase positions in growth and technology stocks, particularly those with long-only strategies. As the country strengthens economic stimulus measures, the mainland stock market has ended six consecutive months of foreign capital outflows. Some investment bank analyses show that the change in capital flows is not entirely due to \"national team\" stock purchases, which helps alleviate investor concerns about the sustainability of the rebound from January lows.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to another research report, Asian funds and emerging market funds in the US and Europe reduced their underweight positions in the country in February. According to EPFR data, net outflows from mainland and Hong Kong stocks last month were $2.2 billion, with 95% attributed to investor redemptions, compared to $2.6 billion in January. Some funds have begun reducing their India holdings, citing overvaluation and that risk-return should be allocated to better places. This shift is absolutely favorable for China to regain lost share in global portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, some global funds that were previously cautious about mainland stocks have recently turned bullish on mainland stocks due to their cheap valuations, financial and regulatory risks that have become more stable than before, and future earnings improvements. This is the strongest evidence of restoring investor confidence in the country. It also suggests that global investors may increasingly believe that the mainland stock market will end its $7 trillion plunge and gradually restore economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, for most foreign investors, overweighting mainland stocks is more difficult than ever before. But as many investors feel that the worst concerns have now been alleviated, and mainland stock valuation multiples are in a depressed state, the risk that can be added should be very low. The CSI 300 index has risen 5% this year, compared to an 11% decline last year, making it one of the worst-performing major indices globally. This rebound is expected to continue as global investors become net buyers of mainland stocks through Hong Kong exchange links.\n",

      "Located in the Hongqi Farm of the Sixth Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the Ji172-H well is not only a meritorious well of the Xinjiang Oilfield Jiqing Oilfield Operation Area, but also an experimental well and cultural well.\n",

      "Building an Oil and Gas Flow \"Highway\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 24, Hongqi Farm was covered in silver, and the Ji172-H well, which has been in continuous production for 13 years, was dressed in a silver-gray thermal \"coat,\" continuing production even in the harsh winter, demonstrating vigorous vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ji172-H well was initially a vertical well that began production in 2011, with relatively poor initial results, producing only 1.8 tons of oil per day. In 2012, the Ji172-H well was converted to a horizontal well, taking an \"L\" shape, first drilling a vertical section, then creating a deviation, and then traversing horizontally along the horizontal section.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ji172-H well has a vertical section of 2,991 meters and a horizontal section of 1,233 meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, petroleum workers implemented fracturing on the Ji172-H well, injecting 16,031 cubic meters of water and 1,798 cubic meters of quartz sand into the formation, making it China's first \"ten thousand cubic meters of fluid, one thousand cubic meters of sand\" volume fracturing process well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shale oil has extremely low permeability, making extraction as difficult as \"squeezing oil from a grindstone.\" Fracturing is implemented to break up and prop open the formation, creating fractures and building an oil and gas flow \"highway\" connecting to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "After fracturing modification, the Ji172-H well began production in September 2012. Using a 4mm oil nozzle for testing, it discharged 117 tons of fluid daily, and after 14 consecutive days of fluid discharge, industrial oil flow was observed. The average daily oil production for one year was 24.5 tons, with a maximum daily production of 69.46 tons, making it China's first shale oil well with industrial value.\n",
      "\n",
      "After flowing naturally for 754 days, the Ji172-H well cumulatively produced 12,400 tons of oil. Due to weakening formation energy, it was converted to pumping production in November 2014, with pumping units lifting the crude oil to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, the Ji172-H well underwent water injection for energy storage to displace remaining shale oil. In 2019, the Ji172-H well underwent a second fracturing, achieving the highest domestic \"ten thousand cubic meters of fluid, one thousand cubic meters of sand\" volume fracturing, injecting a total of 65,430 cubic meters of water and 4,553 cubic meters of quartz sand.\n",

It is Xinjiang Oilfield's first shale oil horizontal well, China's first well to use \"ten thousand cubic meters of fluid, one thousand cubic meters of sand\" volume fracturing in continental shale oil, setting the highest records for fracturing scale and crude oil production in this field, establishing a shale oil extraction model dominated by horizontal wells with large-scale volume fracturing, laying a solid foundation for the efficient development of 1 billion tons of shale oil in the Jimsar Sag.\n",

Initially, there was no electricity at the well site. In winter, they ate boxed meals delivered from outside and drank bottled mineral water. On cold nights, they were so frozen they rolled in bed unable to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "To bring electricity to the well site, they found tree branches to heat the frozen ground, heating while burying cables, finally bringing power to the well site.\n",
      "\n",
      "The well site had no water; water was delivered from outside every three days and stored in a water tank of about 2 cubic meters on the roof. Every summer, the well site was extremely hot, and the three men conserved water, only able to wipe themselves with towels for bathing. \"At that time, the greatest reward was using an extra half basin of water,\" Sun Pengke said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The well site had no mobile phone signal. To make a call home, they had to walk several kilometers on foot, searching for positions with good mobile phone signals in the vast Gobi Desert.\n",

      "Do you still remember the big brothers who waved the five-star red flag on Beacon Hill on July 3rd to welcome our country's first domestically-built aircraft carrier, the Shandong? After their story was reported by Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po All Media, it caused a sensation across the internet. Subsequently, many media outlets including People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, China News Service, and Beijing Time followed up with reports, with this \"Chinese-style romance\" touching the entire internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many netizens left comments hoping the big brothers could board the Shandong, saying \"Just based on these brothers' patriotic hearts, they should be invited to visit the aircraft carrier.\" Through extensive efforts by Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po and DotDotNews, they finally helped Hong Kong residents A Bing and Mr. Zhu realize their dream of boarding the Shandong aircraft carrier. Mr. Zhu arrived early at Central Pier to queue up, expressing that he was very excited and thrilled. \"Last night when I learned I had the chance to visit the Shandong, I was so excited I couldn't sleep,\" he said. He mentioned that it's very rare in one's lifetime to have the opportunity to personally visit an aircraft carrier, and he was very much looking forward to witnessing this \"national treasure\" with his own eyes!\n",
      "\n",
      "During his visit to the Shandong's deck, Mr. Zhu repeatedly used the phrase \"very shocking.\" He said that he finally boarded the country's first independently developed domestic aircraft carrier, the Shandong. \"I'm very shocked. Boarding the Shandong aircraft carrier, words cannot express the excitement in my heart.\" He thanked Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, DotDotNews, and numerous netizens for their strong support, which gave him the opportunity to visit the Shandong aircraft carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zhu expressed that he felt the country has many talented people and is very powerful, displaying much advanced and genuine strength. Seeing the aircraft carrier, fighter jets, torpedo guns, and other equipment in person was very shocking. He frankly stated that he has more confidence in the country, and amid global chaos, he feels the nation's strength, giving him more confidence and sense of security. He thanked the country for protecting Hong Kong's safety.\n",

      "Since the rebound from 2630 points, over four weeks, people have gotten used to making money lying down, thinking this is what their abilities deserve. At 3050 points, considering the new stock issuances over the past year, this position is similar to 3400 points at this time last year. It has already approached the extreme height that existing funds can maintain. At this point, without large amounts of incremental funds entering the market, with daily trading volume of 1.1 trillion, it can only barely maintain the index from falling significantly. The authorities release news every day to fan the flames, just to prevent funds from clustering together, preferably spreading benefits evenly - as long as stability is maintained. At this stage, it's impossible to allow main themes like Sora and new quality productive forces to emerge. Without clear main themes, there's no sector continuity, and without continuity, what you buy and profit from today will fall back tomorrow. This fan-like rotation will make it impossible for people to make money through short-term speculation. The authorities believe that since short-term trading has been made unprofitable, there's only one way to make money in the stock market: become medium to long-term and stay put. If only everything were this simple. Large funds doing short-term trading, if they keep losing, will withdraw and go to cash, or use aggressive selling rhythms to guide retail investor sentiment, continuously creating declines, then profiting from rebounds within downtrends. Since they can't profit from rises, they can only create declines to make money. A-shares seemingly have no short-selling mechanism, but large funds have means to profit from shorting. For example, securities lending. For example, quantitative trading. For example, information gaps, rumors. This Monday, Ningde Times drove the new energy sector to explode, died on Tuesday. This Tuesday, low-altitude economy sector exploded, died on Wednesday. This Wednesday, media and gaming sectors exploded, died on Thursday. This Thursday, innovative drug sector exploded, Friday unknown. This Friday, unknown. Every day sectors try to stand out and break through, these sectors die the next day without even a sound. What's the reason? Compared to the above rotating sectors, computing power center construction and automotive can be considered to have some continuity. I slept late last night, constantly thinking about the future of automotive. Two weeks ago, through summarizing all policy implementation rhythms, I believed the only sector the authorities hope could surge is new energy vehicles. Whether it's heavy industry represented by new quality productive forces or AI technology's application end, everything will eventually become automotive. This year, Seres also invested heavily in advertising and appeared on the Spring Festival Gala. Then its stock price broke through last October's previous high again. If I were a capital institution worth hundreds of billions, playing stocks. I think, besides buying Seres, there's no other choice. If I buy 10 billion in Seres and catch one limit up, I earn 1 billion. I'd need to catch 30 limit ups on Kelai Mechanical & Electrical to earn this 1 billion. Doubling on Seres is worth a year of running around. For AITO cars, the deposit is 5,000 yuan per car. If necessary, I can spend 100 million distributed nationwide to order 20,000 cars to boost sales, I don't want the cars, I'll breach the contract later, I don't want this 100 million deposit, I just want the sales data. As long as there's this exceeding-expectations sales data, let the media hype it up. One limit up for Seres stock and I earn 1 billion, two or three limit ups and nine generations of my family are set for life. So we often see mainstream financial news saying Seres received large orders for how many cars that month, not actual sales, and we rarely see AITO cars on the road. To keep Seres stock price rising continuously, I must also maintain the automotive sector's momentum. As everyone knows, sector continuity atmosphere is driven by news stimulation + consecutive limit-up emotional leaders, like the relationship between Kelai Mechanical & Electrical and new quality productive forces. If I want the automotive sector to show continuity, there are only two methods. 1. Have the authorities continuously issue documents stimulating the automotive industry - I don't need to worry about this, they plan to do it anyway. Because besides EV exports and EV replacement, they have no other means to save the economy. Media public opinion is the blower creating trends. Things like autonomous driving, flying cars, low-altitude economy, Huawei smart driving are all ultimately about selling cars. Like a salesperson's flowery sales pitch. 2. Create an emotional consecutive limit-up leader to lead the automotive sector breakthrough. Like Shenglong Stock's 14 consecutive limit ups in October last year. If Shenglong isn't enough, add Tianlong Stock's 10 consecutive limit ups, then Dongan Power's 9 consecutive limit ups. As long as this leader can fan the automotive sector's sustained heat, Seres will keep rising with the wind. Another 40% rise for Seres might take a month and bring me 6 billion in profit. Is it worth spending 1 billion hiring traders to create two consecutive limit-up automotive leaders? Since retail investors all believe in Yangjia Zhangmeng Hujialou, why not have my traders use their seats to create leaders? Terrifying upon reflection, because if we view the stock market's ecosystem from this capital perspective, the yamen, institutions, media, institutions, hot money, major shareholders - every link in this food chain can profit, except retail investors. With this mindset, I focused on finding automotive small-cap leaders all day today. 1. Starlight shares 3-to-4 This makes lighting, can only be considered automotive electronics type. Can it be an automotive leader? Don't know yet, didn't get a chance to participate. The traces of large funds creating it are too obvious. Previously, Aiai Precision's first 4 boards, most people said industrial chain, no way to participate, following means death. Result: consecutive gap-up limit ups, outlasting all opponents, today's 8th board gorgeous transformation into market total leader. So, can't subjectively discriminate against these limit-up boards, right? 2. Yingli Automotive 2-to-3 Northeast small car company, small market cap, too small, only 1.1 billion in circulation. Small means too much uncontrollability. If traders accidentally buy over 5% market cap, becoming required disclosure and 6-month lock-up, that would be troublesome. Yingli's first board was created by Yangjia, 2nd board also maintained by his T+0 trading. If it actively goes to 3rd board today, it becomes automotive position leader, provided it kicks out Starlight. Unfortunately, waited until afternoon, also trying reverse package board, ultimately no one valued it, also insufficient strength. 3. Dongan Power 1-to-2 Among remaining automotive first boards from yesterday, only Dongan Power and Songzhi shares. Songzhi makes automotive air conditioning, Dongan makes engines, and is one of the old Huawei automotive concept leaders. Last October when Seres emerged, the emotional cycle leaders also switched from Shenglong shares ~ Tianlong shares ~ Dongan Power. Now, switching back might work too. So this afternoon, I saw Dongan Power 2nd board, Tianlong shares 1st board, Shenglong shares surging. Personal operation: Gave up Yingli Automotive - it rebounded without hitting limit, I couldn't get a definitive buy point, had to give up. Hit limit-up board for Dongan Power, after successful queue, 50 million sealing orders were eaten in 5 minutes. Later funds also pulled Tianlong to first board, Shenglong surged, stimulating Dongan to re-seal. Tomorrow Dongan needs to continue strengthening consecutive boards to attract market attention, actively enhance automotive leader temperament, suppress Starlight. If it can't do it alone, can only let big brother Shenglong and second brother Tianlong help together. As for tomorrow's result, truly can't tell for now. Since funds pulled Shenglong, Tianlong, Dongan simultaneously today, they probably want to use these three old automotive leaders to stimulate in turns, driving Huawei automotive atmosphere. Why do this? I believe the only explanation is they've ambushed large positions in Seres, Wanfeng Auto, JAC Motors beforehand. Creating automotive sector explosive emotional atmosphere, if maintained for four weeks, they can achieve doubling returns, earning hundreds of billions in profit. According to this logic I described, applied to computing power sector, it's also reasonable. There must be funds that ambushed large positions in Foxconn Industrial Internet, Inspur Information, Unigroup Guoxin, Sugon and other computing power core large caps. Then they maintain Gaoxin Development's stock price, create an Annil-like computing power emotional leader to drive the sector. As long as NVIDIA keeps rising, computing power will follow. AI computing power center construction is like real estate 20 years ago. Either don't believe, or believe early. Just treat it as musical chairs. So Foxconn Industrial Internet, Gaoxin Development's current market caps are still at the foot of the mountain in my eyes. Currently there's a small problem - Foxconn Industrial Internet's performance isn't great. There's an emotional negative sentiment causing stock price pullback. I remember first half last year was 1% growth, now it's become 4.82% full-year growth, very stable. 2024 is the first year of AI, this year's performance is the key point. However, what I say is useless, people dislike the performance growth being too slow and too little. Value investors will calculate indicators and think its current performance corresponds to overly inflated stock price, so they dump it. So its stock price fell, so everyone inevitably says it's no good. Computing power core Gaoxin Development is still consolidating sideways, can't rise or fall much, temporarily separated from short-term acceleration phase. Going forward, it's trading time for space, quietly rising when you're not watching. If Gaoxin can't break through, Huawei computing power can't stand out, then must create another small leader like Annil to drive the sector. That's why there's CETC's 4 unbuyable limit-up boards. CETC can also be considered Huawei computing power, just happened to coincide with weekend exposure of Huawei magnetic storage technology, bringing Maxscend with this wind for 4 boards. CETC had two blast-offs this morning, could be bought. Including Aiai Precision this afternoon could also hit blast-off and re-seal buy points. But most of my positions are trapped in Chuanrun shares. I really can't understand this gap-down limit-down move, the purpose behind it. If I must explain, it's like hot money's emotional venting. Chuanrun had 4 limit-ups, 5\n",

In the future, 'Chengdu-made' products will take trains to the sea from here.\" Upon learning the news that the Huang (Huangtong in Puding County, Guizhou) - Bai (Baise, Guangxi) Railway was announced for construction, Yao Sidan, National CPPCC member and Vice Chairman of Sichuan Provincial CPPCC, who has been closely following the construction of the Western Land-Sea New Corridor, said excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the biggest bottleneck in the current construction of the western route of the Western Land-Sea New Corridor, Yao Sidan has deep feelings about the complexity and lag of infrastructure construction along the route - the entire line has a bridge-tunnel ratio as high as 86.19% and crosses elevations of over 1,000 meters. Currently, this shortest freight corridor from Southwest China to the Beibu Gulf sea outlet faces problems such as low railway line grades that urgently need capacity expansion and renovation, as well as serious underutilization of scarce water transport resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, Yao Sidan suggests establishing special construction funds for the Western Land-Sea New Corridor construction at the national level to promote railway capacity expansion and renovation along the corridor and accelerate the completion of the Huangtong-Baise Railway; upgrading a batch of aviation, railway, and water transport ports to national-level open ports, and promoting the enhancement of logistics hub cities' open platform functions. Expand new western water transport corridors connecting with the Yangtze River Economic Belt development, and coordinate the promotion of the rail-water intermodal transport corridor of Yangtze River (Chengdu, Chongqing, Luzhou, Yibin) - Jinsha River (Panzhihua, Kunming) - China-Myanmar Railway (China-Laos-Thailand Railway, China-Vietnam Railway) - Kyaukpyu Port (Laem Chabang Port, Ho Chi Minh Port).\n",

      "Addressing issues such as incomplete coordination mechanisms, insufficient support policy strength, and operational levels that need improvement, Yao Sidan calls for the establishment of special cooperation mechanisms led by the main leaders of governments of provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) along the corridor as soon as possible, to promote at a high level and coordinate solutions to market operation difficulties, and to coordinate the advancement of information platform construction, cargo source cultivation, logistics transportation, and external coordination among provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) along the corridor.\n",

      "Yun Kui is a post-80s forest and grassland fire prevention and suppression commander at the Baotou Municipal Bureau of Forestry and Grassland. He has been fighting on the front lines of forest and grassland fire prevention and suppression work year-round, living alongside forests and making mountains his home. Whether in frigid winter or scorching summer, his diligent patrolling figure can always be seen in deep mountain ravines and valleys.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fire prevention work, Yun Kui continuously updates his professional knowledge and actively studies the development patterns of forest and grassland fire prevention and suppression work. To precisely focus efforts in fire prevention and suppression work, being prepared is crucial. He has repeatedly ventured deep into key forest and grassland areas, attempting to identify all types of fire hazards. His colleagues all say: \"Yun Kui is a 'living map' - for remote mountain valleys that can't be found on real maps, asking him will definitely work!\" His solid professional skills have laid a firm foundation for his fire prevention and suppression work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baotou is located in an arid and semi-arid region, making fire source control extremely difficult. To solve the challenges in fire prevention work, Yun Kui, with the goal of optimizing governance, innovatively proposed a \"four-wheel drive\" grid management mechanism. Under his leadership, Baotou has achieved zero fire incidents during critical periods for multiple consecutive years. In 2022, facing the most severe fire risk level in Baotou's history, Yun Kui organized over 60 various publicity activities, traveled more than 20,000 kilometers, investigated over 5,000 hazard points and 78,000 scattered graves, achieving \"fire sources don't enter forests, sacrificial activities don't enter mountains, and hazards don't exist in key areas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Baotou has over 160 main fire prevention gully entrances, and Yun Kui knows the location of each one like the back of his hand. Across the city's 10 banner counties and districts, whenever fire prevention and suppression work encounters difficulties, everyone's first thought is to \"find Yun Kui.\" To provide precise services to grassroots units, Yun Kui insists on visiting all banner counties and districts monthly, communicating face-to-face with firefighters and grassroots officials. To handle fire situations promptly, throughout his more than 10 years of work, he never turns off his phone. Whenever he receives fire alarms in the middle of the night, he always rushes to the fire scene immediately. Winds are generally stronger at night, and vehicles cannot approach most fire scenes, making hiking over mountains and staying awake all night common occurrences, but Yun Kui has become accustomed to it all. He always says: \"If I don't go to the scene, my heart will still fly to the fire site.\"\n",

      "Among Shanghai's more than 3,000 commercial projects, small-scale \"small but beautiful\" commercial spaces have frequently gained popularity in recent years, becoming breakout hits despite being \"surrounded and intercepted\" by large shopping centers. According to CRIC statistics, small-scale new projects accounted for over 50% of Shanghai's newly opened centralized commercial projects from 2020-2023. This shows that small-scale commercial projects are gradually emerging. Among them, 86 commercial projects of various types are planned to open this year, with small-scale commercial spaces accounting for more than half, indicating that Shanghai has entered a peak period for small-scale commercial market entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Space constraints are the biggest pain point for small-scale commercial spaces. Due to their small size, they face issues such as fewer merchants, insufficient browsability, and low exposure. They are considered controversial for being \"inferior to shopping centers in terms of rich experiences, and inferior to convenience stores in terms of convenience and discounts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, small-scale commercial spaces have become a hot topic again. On one hand, the pandemic increased people's demand for nearby consumption, and standardized community commercial spaces have been increasing year by year. On the other hand, existing commercial spaces have entered a peak renovation period, with some old commercial projects, old factories, and old properties in core locations successively entering the market as small-scale, distinctive, non-standard commercial spaces, attracting many young people to visit and check in.\n",
      "\n",
      "For small commercial spaces, the smooth operation of permanent business formats is just the foundation. The key to gathering popularity and maintaining vitality lies in maintaining keen observation of consumer activities and seizing opportunities accordingly. Developers including Yinli, Vanke, Longfor, and CIFI are actively deploying small-scale commercial spaces and have formed their own representative community commercial product lines. This shows that small-scale commercial spaces also hide new opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to CRIC statistics, among Shanghai's newly opened centralized commercial projects from 2020-2023, small-scale new projects accounted for over 50%, with \"renovated\" small-scale upgrade projects accounting for an increasing proportion year by year, occupying about 60% of newly opened small-scale commercial spaces in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the stock era, more and more small-scale commercial projects have become important components of urban renewal and renovation. On one hand, many small-scale commercial spaces were built and entered the market early, mostly located in traditional business districts or old urban areas, and have reached the time point where they need \"renovation.\" On the other hand, under changing market environments and consumer demographics, plus market pressure brought by three years of pandemic, competition has become increasingly fierce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to their small scale, small-scale commercial spaces have limited brand numbers available for planning and investment attraction, resulting in few and outdated business formats. Early planning cannot match current new consumption trends, leading to unreasonable internal and external layouts and functional configurations, clearly lacking market competitiveness in the ever-changing consumer market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shanghai's small-scale renovation projects are mainly concentrated in traditional core commercial districts, such as Middle Huaihai Road, Xintiandi, West Nanjing Road, Zhongshan Park, and North Sichuan Road, all of which have had new projects enter the market in recent years. This is understandable, as old commercial district projects opened early and have many large-scale quality malls. Small-scale commercial spaces, facing high operating costs and overly outdated business formats, can no longer form a win-win consumer ecosystem or complementary business formats with large-scale commercial spaces, making upgrade and innovation their only way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constrained by space limitations, over 80% of small-scale commercial spaces position themselves as \"popular,\" but popular doesn't mean clichéd. Innovation, personality, and scenario-driven approaches, with different customer groups and different needs, have given rise to new combinations and new forms of small-scale commercial spaces. Some actively construct distinctive and personalized scenarios, bringing customers completely new consumption experiences; others actively \"combine\" with other business formats, seeking new solutions for upgrade and renovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most small-scale commercial spaces face serious homogenization, with high repetition rates in commercial formats and no unique memorable points. Therefore, the first step in upgrade and renovation is to readjust development direction, establish mall themes, create distinctive features, form unique competitive advantages, and attract consumer attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shanghai Bailian ZX Creative Plaza, which newly opened at the beginning of this year, is a typical representative. The project's predecessor was Nanjing Road Hualian Department Store. After changing its approach and upgrading, it quickly became the center of Shanghai's dimensional culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Shanghai's first themed commercial space focusing on dimensional culture, the project introduced many local original and overseas popular anime two-dimensional IPs, and set up various scenarios based on different anime stories. For example, the mall interior uses strip lights and rolling LED screens to continuously display classic lines from two-dimensional anime: \"Coach, teach me basketball,\" \"In the name of the moon, I'll punish you,\" etc., striving to create a consumption scenario with content, experience, and social aspects that can resonate with young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project simultaneously introduced a large number of brand flagship stores and flagship stores, covering all business formats from retail and entertainment to dining. However, as a themed commercial space, Bailian ZX Creative Plaza's dining proportion is much lower than conventional commercial projects, with a large number of brand flagship stores and flagship stores serving as the core business formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although these brands have customer flow attraction attributes, if they were just conventional independent stores, they might not achieve the current effect. Through refined thematic positioning, Bailian ZX Creative Plaza allows different brands to both support each other and create good interaction and social atmosphere for their respective target customer groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since opening, the renovated Bailian ZX Creative Plaza has averaged over 20,000 daily visitors. On May 1st, daily visitor flow exceeded 70,000, more than triple that before renovation, with maximum daily sales also exceeding 2 million yuan, showing significant renovation results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike comprehensive commercial and office spaces that are often relatively independent, the commercial-office integration of small-scale commercial renovation involves converting some low-efficiency high-floor spaces into flexible new office spaces, thereby achieving commercial-office integration that is flexible and mutually beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The previously \"viral\" Henderson Cifi Square is a representative project of commercial-office integration, combining flexible office, luxury commercial, and public spaces. The project's \"office upstairs, commercial downstairs\" layout both avoids problems with commercial investment attraction and customer flow guidance on high floors, and brings direct customers to both commercial and office spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of business formats and brands, it also chose dining, beauty and body care, and healthy lifestyle brands that are rigid demands of office groups as main business formats. For example, Daily Dark Chocolate flagship store, Royal FrieslandCampina Innovation Experience Center, Istituto Marangoni alumni brand collection store, etc., all simultaneously play the roles of office building tenants and commercial tenants.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, in product design, the project creates an environment and atmosphere conducive to office workers' socializing through the use of elements such as streets, terraces, and vertical greening, forming connections with commercial spaces to achieve the effect of office providing quality customer sources for commercial spaces and commercial spaces providing supporting services for office spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since opening, Henderson Cifi Square has maintained commercial and office occupancy rates of basically over 90%, with rents achieving approximately 20% premium over surrounding markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking across Shanghai, the \"commercial-to-office\" model is being tried by more and more projects, such as early Huaihai 627, Nanfeng City, and recent Suosuochuangyi MIX, LaLaStation Lianhua Life Plaza, etc. Although in traditional perception, commercial rents are lower than office rents, in a volatile market environment, being able to achieve lower but stable returns while effectively disposing of spaces that are difficult to lease and adding additional customer consumption vitality to commercial portions is also a good new choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although not every project following this transformation and upgrade approach will necessarily succeed, focusing on themed commercial and commercial-office integration practices points out new directions worth trying for small-scale commercial transformation and upgrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-scale themed commercial spaces break through traditional commercial templates and attempt more interesting content, such as the aforementioned Bailian ZX Creative Plaza and INS Fuxing Park, which respectively entered the two-dimensional and e-sports markets favored by young people, creating distinctive features in commercial differentiation and interactive experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the two cases of Bailian ZX Creative Plaza and Henderson Cifi Square, strengthening experience, emphasizing communication, creating differentiation, seeking cooperation... these are all factors that break through limitations brought by small scale and create unique project characteristics and advantages.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hearing that the diagnoses from both the provincial tertiary hospital and the primary healthcare institution doctors were consistent, both concluding there was nothing serious, Mr. Qin and his wife repeatedly expressed their gratitude. \"We live near this health center. Initially, we thought the health center couldn't meet our medical needs, but after coming here, we discovered that not only is the environment good, but the information technology applications are impressive. We can receive auxiliary diagnosis from provincial tertiary hospitals without going to Haikou. This is so convenient!\" Mr. Qin exclaimed.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the reporter's analysis, Chenguang Biotech Group Co., Ltd. achieved operating revenue of 5.225 billion yuan in the first three quarters, up 1.08% year-on-year. Chenguang Biotech stated that the company's stevia sugar has significant cost advantages over competitors due to innovative production processes. From the perspective of process complexity and cost leadership margin, stevia sugar's future steady-state gross profit margin should be higher than products like paprika oleoresin and capsicum extract.\n",

      "The third-quarter report recently released by Baolingbao Biology Co., Ltd. showed that the company achieved operating revenue of 1.833 billion yuan in the first three quarters, down 6.70% year-on-year. According to reports, Baolingbao actively deployed high value-added products such as prebiotics, dietary fiber, sugar substitutes, DHA, HMO, and lactulose, increased investment in process optimization for prebiotic, dietary fiber, and sugar substitute production lines, and collaborated with research institutions to accelerate the introduction of new products to meet the growing demand for healthy consumption.\n",

At the national level, strong momentum continues to be injected into the development of the private economy, continuously optimizing the business environment, enabling enterprises to achieve more substantial development. However, the industry still faces numerous domestic and international risks and challenges, including energy price fluctuations, exchange rate volatility, relatively weak consumer markets, slight contraction in demand, rising raw material prices, and overcapacity in some sectors. These factors pose considerable pressure on enterprise development. Nevertheless, enterprises are actively responding by continuously exploring technological innovation paths, increasing investment in technological innovation, safety, and environmental protection, striving to address market uncertainties through technological progress and quality improvement. At the same time, enterprises are continuously optimizing internal management and working to stimulate the innovative vitality of market entities, providing strong support for the industry's high-quality development.\n",

      "The number of patients with ophthalmic diseases is increasing, with dry eye disease and myopia affecting many patient populations in China. At the beginning of this year, the hit drama \"The Knockout\" featured the character Gao Qiqiang being diagnosed with dry eye disease, bringing greater awareness to this condition. While dry eye disease may not sound like a frightening \"terminal illness,\" this disease not only negatively impacts patients' quality of life but can even lead to permanent vision damage, making it not to be underestimated. It is estimated that by 2030, the domestic dry eye disease drug market will grow significantly to $6.7 billion, with broad market prospects and enormous drug demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry eye disease is a diagnosed condition caused by reduced tear secretion or excessive tear evaporation that results in dry eyes, and there are various therapeutic drugs for its treatment. Artificial tears are the most commonly used and fundamental dry eye eye drops. With technological development, safer and more effective cyclosporine drugs are receiving increasing attention. Many domestic pharmaceutical companies are joining the layout of cyclosporine dry eye drugs through introduction, imitation, or independent research and development, among which Xingqi Pharmaceutical's Zirun is the first cyclosporine generic drug to be launched domestically. Additionally, many new mechanism dry eye drugs are being developed clinically, including perfluorohexyloctane Miebo launched in May this year, TRPM8 agonist AR-15512 in Phase III clinical trials, and new-generation LFA-1 antagonist VVN-001 in Phase II clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Large Market Scale with Rapid Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "With the popularization of electronic products and intensifying aging, the incidence of ophthalmic diseases is increasing. Eye diseases mainly include ocular inflammation, glaucoma, cataracts, visual fatigue, myopia, and dry eye disease, with refractive errors and dry eye disease having the largest patient base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry eye disease, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a diagnosed condition of eye dryness caused by reduced tear secretion or excessive tear evaporation. There are various causes, such as excessive dependence on electronic products, air pollution, long-term eye makeup use, wearing contact lenses, and vitamin A deficiency leading to dry eyes.\n",

      "NO.1 Artificial Tears\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial tears have become the fundamental medication for dry eye treatment, serving as a substitute for human tears. They are typically water-soluble high molecular polymers that, when applied topically to the eyes, provide soothing and lubricating effects to the ocular mucosa, thereby alleviating dry eye symptoms. They come in both eye drop and eye ointment forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial tears in the domestic market mainly include sodium hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid, and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations. Among these, sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic preparations are currently the largest-selling dry eye eye drops in the hospital market, with a market share exceeding 25%, followed by hyaluronic acid ophthalmic preparations and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations, accounting for approximately 25.8% and 25.6% respectively. However, in recent two years, hospital sales of sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid have shown a declining trend, while recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor ophthalmic preparations such as Yisheng Biotech's Beifushu have shown an upward trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, artificial tears available on the domestic market include: SYSTANE® ULTRA (Siran), Refresh plus (Liangshi), Aili, Runjie, Runshu, Beifushu (containing recombinant human fibroblast growth factor), Leiran, and Taisho Pharmaceutical's Alice artificial tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial tears are still different from tears produced by the human body. Most artificial tear eye drops contain preservatives, and frequent, repeated use can damage the cornea, so it's best to use them under medical guidance.\n",

      "NO.2 Immunosuppressants (Cyclosporine Eye Drops)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyclosporine eye drops have widespread applications in ophthalmology, but different concentrations serve different purposes. Currently, there are mainly three types of cyclosporine eye drops on the domestic market:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 1% cyclosporine eye drops (3 mL:30 mg) mainly used for preventing and treating immune rejection after corneal transplantation;\n",
      "2. 0.1% cyclosporine eye drops (III) (0.3 mL:0.3 mg) mainly used for treating severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children and adolescents aged 4 and above;\n",
      "3. 0.05% cyclosporine eye drops (II) (0.4 mL:0.2 mg) mainly used for dry eye patients.\n",

      "\n",
      "Old project renovations and new project launches have made the western Beijing area a rising star among Beijing's commercial districts. Recently, Beijing Business Today reporters visited Shougang Park in Shijingshan and found that Shougang Park's Liugonghui commercial section—Liugonghui Shopping Plaza—has already opened some stores and introduced several flagship-level brands. In fact, commercial updates in western Beijing have never stopped, with examples including the completion of new rounds of adjustments at Contemporary Mall Dingcheng Store and Jinding Times Square. Analysis indicates that leveraging the \"post-Winter Olympics\" momentum, western Beijing's commercial development potential is enormous, and how to create synergy between new and old projects is an issue the commercial district needs to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Shijingshan Welcomes Liugonghui's Market Entry**\n",
      "\n",
      "Liugonghui has carried a \"halo\" since its inception, drawing additional attention through the popularity of the Winter Olympics. Beijing Business Today reporters observed during their visit that Shougang Park has become a new landmark for family outings and outdoor sports, while Liugonghui Shopping Plaza serves as the only commercial facility in the entire park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design combining indoor and outdoor spaces attracts many consumers to visit. Upon entering Liugonghui Shopping Plaza, visitors are greeted by a strong industrial atmosphere. The mall has four floors covering automotive showrooms, dining, entertainment, parent-child activities, fitness, and other formats. Notably, the terrace spaces are a major feature of Liugonghui Shopping Plaza, allowing consumers to enjoy views of the New Shougang Bridge, Shougang Ski Jump, and Qunming Lake from different terraces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of brands, the first batch of operating stores includes restaurants such as Xiaodiao Pear Soup, Jiuben Izakaya, Guanhe Beef, and Shougang Taste, as well as the Beijing flagship store of Li Auto and the western Beijing flagship store of NIO House. Previously, the project manager told Beijing Business Today reporters that Shougang Park's Liugonghui commercial area mainly aims to meet the needs of young people, quality families, and high-end white-collar workers. The project has introduced 7 China flagship stores, 2 Beijing flagship stores, and 14 western Beijing flagship stores in its tenant recruitment. Examples include the China mainland and Beijing flagship store of Chang'an Ji Restaurant, and NEL-B Technology Center as Beijing's first super flagship store.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to reports, Shougang Park's Liugonghui is an important component of Shougang Park, located in the core area of Shougang Park's northern district. With a total construction area of 224,000 square meters, it consists of six interconnected plots, including 11 standalone industrial buildings, 11 standalone flagship commercial buildings, and one shopping plaza. Liugonghui Shopping Plaza targets families and Generation Z as its main consumer groups, focusing on comprehensive consumption combining \"experience + showroom + dining.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Peng, Associate Professor at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China, believes that not only should Liugonghui Shopping Center be considered, but the entire Shougang industrial district should move toward personalized transformation. For example, it could leverage its factory-style architectural structures to introduce new consumption formats and utilize existing Winter Olympics venues to create an integrated cultural-tourism consumption model, thereby increasing appeal to young consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Accelerated Commercial Updates in Surrounding Areas**\n",
      "\n",
      "The market entry of Liugonghui Shopping Plaza has undoubtedly injected new vitality into the western Beijing commercial district. Previously, Jinding Times Square, located about 6 kilometers from Shougang Park, had just completed a round of renovations. This project borrowed from the Huaxi LIVE·Wukesong model, working with the surrounding Shougang Basketball Center and Sam's Club to create a traditional commercial upgrade example integrating sports, leisure, dining, and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jinding Times Square has been built and operating for more than ten years. Equipment and facilities are aging, the overall facade is outdated, the eastern sunken plaza has low utilization, and the correlation between various themed formats is poor,\" said Wang Jinlong, Chairman of Beijing Shixing Group Co., Ltd., in a previous interview, mentioning that renovation and upgrading of this commercial district had become an urgent issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Wang Jinlong stated that Shixing Group has enhanced the external landscape environment of Jinding Times Square, utilized idle spaces, tapped the potential of underutilized spaces, created a T-shaped interior street, and connected the underground food street with the T-shaped interior street and sunken plaza commercial circulation, increasing foot traffic to the old project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at Beijing's commercial landscape, Shijingshan District also faces challenges such as insufficient advantages in leading industries, public service supply quality that still needs improvement, and the urgent need to strengthen the modernization of governance systems and capabilities. Yuan Shuai, a member of the China Cultural Management Association, pointed out that \"urban renewal and industrial transformation have become key drivers for accelerated development of western Beijing commerce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the Shijingshan District Commerce Bureau revealed that Jinding Times Square will fully utilize \"post-Winter Olympics\" opportunities to create a new regional commercial characteristic sample. Beijing Business Today reporters learned that in the future, traditional large commercial complexes such as Wanda Plaza and Joy City in the western Beijing commercial district will also undergo renovation and upgrading, updating indoor and outdoor hardware equipment and facilities, and adjusting brand formats around flagship stores and nighttime economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond traditional project upgrades, the western Beijing area is not only welcoming Liugonghui's market entry but will also welcome large complexes such as Jin'an Huanyu Hui and Beijing West Joy City in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tapping \"Post-Winter Olympics\" Potential**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Winter Olympics has driven attention to the western Beijing area, but how to seize \"post-Winter Olympics\" opportunities, strengthen high-end consumption supply, and enhance regional consumption capacity has become a new proposition. To this end, Shijingshan District will introduce several measures for accelerating high-quality development of the commercial economy in Shijingshan District in 2022, providing financial support in areas such as consumption promotion activities, flagship store brands, and nighttime economic development. It has taken the lead in establishing a special fund for cultivating and building an international consumption center city, with 15 million yuan annually, focusing on policy rewards, event organization, promotional activities, and other work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Peng stated that the western Beijing area is not only Beijing's backyard garden but can also become a destination for Beijing consumers' lifestyle services, consumption, and entertainment. The area can leverage historical and cultural resources such as Moshi Kou Commercial Cultural Street and Gucheng South Road Pedestrian Street to tap the potential of cultural and creative consumption, helping the western Beijing commercial district find its own positioning and characteristics within Beijing's overall commercial landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xing Qinhui, Deputy Director of Shijingshan District Commerce Bureau, introduced that Shijingshan will cultivate New Shougang Park into a global premiere consumption circle featuring \"sports + creativity\" and create a new highland for international brand consumption. At the same time, Shijingshan will also cultivate \"post-Winter Olympics\" economy, flagship store economy, and nighttime economy, gathering flagship stores, concept stores, and experience centers in the region, improving the layout of emerging formats such as high-end dining, fashion brands, and healthy living, striving to introduce more than 50 Beijing flagship stores of well-known domestic and international brands this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the \"post-Winter Olympics\" momentum, as the western Beijing commercial district continues to update, it should further strengthen the \"technological sense\" that young people love. Yuan Shuai suggested that the area should also target certain fields of digital economic development, whether in industrial introduction or commercial experimentation, through the collaborative integration of virtual reality, augmented reality with science fiction, gaming, and other creative industries, to achieve digital renewal of the region and make the western Beijing commercial district a highland for comprehensive urban livelihood service guarantees.\n",

      "In recent years, wireless phone chargers have gained widespread consumer favor due to their convenience of not requiring data cable plugging and unplugging, and allowing phones to charge with just a simple placement. How do the performance and quality of wireless phone chargers that claim \"fast charging with case on, intelligent matching compatibility, and efficient low-temperature charging\" measure up? On July 23, the Shanghai Consumer Rights Protection Committee released the comparative test results for wireless phone chargers: Among 18 samples, 6 models including Zhiguozhe and Newman Newmine failed to pass foreign object detection test requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6 Samples Failed Foreign Object Detection Standards**\n",
      "\n",
      "According to reports, this comparative test purchased 18 wireless phone chargers through multiple e-commerce platforms, including 4 original chargers from Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, and Vivo, and 14 non-original chargers from brands like Bull, UGREEN, and Baseus. Sample prices ranged from 29.9 yuan to 329 yuan, with original samples averaging 289 yuan and non-original samples averaging 90 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comparative test focused on product safety and charging performance that consumers care about, conducting tests on heating, charging protection, and foreign object detection according to national standards. It also simulated actual consumer usage scenarios to compare charging times and transmission distances of different samples, and examined the appearance and labeling of samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test found that in terms of safety, 6 out of 18 samples failed to pass foreign object detection test requirements. This comparative test detected sample safety according to mandatory national standard GB 4943.1—2022, finding that all 18 samples met standards for heating and charging protection indicators, with maximum temperatures during charging ranging from 29.7-67.0°C, and all automatically switching to low-power mode after full charge. However, 6 samples failed foreign object detection tests, unable to effectively identify approaching metal objects and stop charging, causing object temperatures to exceed standard limits. For example, a wireless charger with manufacturer/distributor listed as Guangzhou Feishi Electronic Technology Co., Ltd./Shenzhen Yuncheng Technology Co., Ltd., branded as Zhiguozhe, model WX1-Black, production date 2023.12.13; and a 15W wireless charger from Beijing Newman Tengfei Technology Co., Ltd., branded as Newman Newmine, model WXC01, production date 2023.12, among others. These 6 samples that failed safety tests were excluded from performance comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Domestic Phone Original Chargers Have High Power**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Protection Committee pointed out that charging time is one of the performance aspects consumers care about most, and charging time is closely related to charger power. Among the 12 samples that passed safety tests, 3 had 50W power, 6 had 15W power, and 3 had 10W power. Tests found that original chargers all execute proprietary protocols, and for their own brand models, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo samples could all provide 50W power charging, while Apple could provide 15W power charging. Non-original chargers can only execute open protocols, with power mostly between 10W and 20W.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, higher power means shorter charging time. This comparative test simulated actual consumer usage scenarios, observing the time samples took to charge load devices from 0% to 100% battery. Tests found that when original chargers used same-brand fast-charging compatible models as load devices, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo samples all took under 2 hours to charge, with Huawei taking only 64 minutes, performing best; Apple took about 2.7 hours. When Huawei and Apple chargers were swapped, Huawei's 50W wireless charger could reach 11W power when charging Apple phones, taking about 2.9 hours; Apple's 15W wireless charger could reach 6.8W power when charging Huawei phones, taking nearly 5 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the 8 non-original chargers, tests uniformly selected two popular phones (HUAWEI P60 and iPhone 14) as load devices, finding significant differences in charging times among the 8 samples, averaging about 3 to 5 hours. Specifically, charging times for HUAWEI P60 ranged from 2 hours 47 minutes to 5 hours 35 minutes, and for iPhone 14 from 2 hours 58 minutes to 4 hours 32 minutes. ZMI, UGREEN, and ESR samples all charged both load devices within 3 hours, performing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tests found that to reduce battery wear, some chargers and phones have automatic charging power adjustment functions, such as fast charging at high power to 90%, then switching to trickle slow charging to 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, not requiring phone case removal and supporting \"charging with case on\" is a major selling point of wireless chargers. This comparative test selected two common phone cases for verification testing, and also used A4 paper to simulate phone cases, testing the maximum thickness of A4 paper that could be placed between phone and wireless charger while maintaining charging, as the sample's maximum transmission distance. Tests found that all 12 samples supported \"charging with case on,\" with maximum transmission distances ranging from 3.9mm to 7.6mm, averaging 6.0mm maximum transmission distance, with all 4 original chargers having maximum transmission distances above 6.0mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, tests also conducted verification testing on radiation concerns that consumers have, finding that all tested samples had radiation values within standard limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**●Consumer Reminder**\n",
      "**Original Products Better for Phone \"Fast Charging\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Protection Committee reminds consumers to pay attention to wireless charger power and phone-supported power before purchasing, as actual charging occurs at the lower power of the two, with matching being optimal. Due to protocol restrictions, 50W high-power chargers are mostly original phone products that can achieve fast charging for corresponding same-brand models, while non-original products' so-called \"fast charging\" can mostly only reach maximum 15W power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original phone products charge fast but are more expensive, while non-original products charge slower but are cheaper - choose according to your needs. Product packaging labels should clearly state manufacturer name, maximum power, model specifications, and other information. Carefully check by examining appearance and smelling for odors to ensure no gaps or strange smells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose chargers with cooling fans and good heat dissipation to avoid temperature control systems limiting charging power due to excessive heat, thus ensuring charging efficiency. Magnetic objects (such as magnetic strips or chips on credit cards, smart keys, etc.) placed nearby may cause product damage and affect charger performance. It's recommended to avoid placing magnetic objects or metal items on the charger surface long-term to prevent equipment heating or malfunction. (Liu Hao)\n",

      "The Qingshui River basin in southeastern Guizhou has numerous stone inscriptions and is known as the \"Museum of Inscription Culture.\" Among them, Jinping, Tianzhu, Liping, Cengong, Zhenyuan, Jianhe, Leishan, Rongjiang and other counties have relatively dense distributions. Jinping County alone preserves over 1,200 ancient stone tablets to this day (not including road markers and tombstones). Most of these inscriptions relate to social management, agricultural and forestry production, and trade. In production and daily life practices, they advocate the concept of \"valuing ecology, emphasizing integrity, and following etiquette and law,\" emphasizing harmony between humans and nature and embodying fair interests. Although during the long historical process, some inscriptions have disappeared without trace due to human destruction and natural erosion from weathering, a considerable portion has been preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "These ancient inscription documents constitute a developmental history of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Deeply excavating, inheriting, and promoting the ecological, environmental, and harmonious concepts contained in the ancient inscription documents of the Qingshui River will provide beneficial insights for the unity and progress of ethnic minority regions and high-quality economic and social development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ecological Genes, Green Vision**\n",
      "\n",
      "The inscription documents preserved in the Qingshui River basin cover politics, economics, military affairs, cultural education, taxation and corvée labor, folk customs, ecological and environmental protection, and other aspects. Based on content, they can be roughly divided into seven major categories: agricultural and forestry production management, transportation construction, construction of schools, temples, ancestral halls and wells, changing customs, taxation and corvée labor, commemorating figures, and recording events. Among them, ancient tablets reflecting forestry production, management, and environmental protection in forest areas account for about 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Qingshui River basin is a key forest area in southern China, with over 500 years of timber production history. For a long time, people have lived off the mountains, naturally forming excellent traditions of tree planting and forest protection. At the same time, timber exports brought in Han culture, and ethnic minorities such as the Miao and Dong in the Qingshui River basin were inspired by timber production and trade, giving birth to numerous village regulations, folk agreements, and contracts. To make these regulations effective in social governance, people not only wrote these regulations on paper, cloth strips, and wooden pieces, but also carved important regulations on stone tablets, erecting them in villages, docks, and roadsides for people to consciously implement and mutually supervise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2002, a joint field research team composed of experts and scholars in history, anthropology, cultural studies, and folklore from Tsinghua University, Sun Yat-sen University, Oxford University, and other institutions conducted a special investigation of folk contract documents and traditional villages in the Qingshui River. They gave extremely high academic value assessment to the Qingshui River forestry contract documents (including ancient inscription documents): \"The forestry contract documents are a historical record of 500 years of artificial afforestation in the Qingshui River community. The concepts of equality, mutual benefit, environmental protection, forestry management, and survival and development reflected in these ancient documents are advanced even by today's standards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Qingshui River forestry inscription documents reflect centuries of green development concepts of \"keeping green mountains forever, sustainable utilization.\" Such ecological consciousness and collective community interest consciousness and other innovative practices are exemplars of folk moral governance and self-governance in ethnic minority regions.\n",

      "On the south bank of the Qingshui River Sanbanxi Power Station reservoir area, there is an ancient village - Wendou Miao Village. In the village stands an ancient environmental protection tablet called the \"Six Prohibitions Tablet,\" erected in the 38th year of Emperor Qianlong's reign (1773) during the Qing Dynasty. The ancient tablet clearly stipulates:\n",
      "\n",
      "First prohibition: Regardless of distance, cedar trees are what we depend on. Adults and children are not permitted to cut them. Violators will be fined ten taels of silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second prohibition: Each household's terraced sections, if damaged in the future, must be repaired by themselves. Those who do not comply will be fined five taels of silver, and the community will repair them, to be passed down to future generations for compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third prohibition: The oil mountains in all four directions shall not be randomly cut or collected. Violators will be fined five taels of silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth prohibition: Hereafter on the dragon terraces, livestock are not permitted to trample. Violators will be fined three taels of silver for repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth prohibition: Diseased pigs and cattle are not permitted to be driven into the village, lest lawless people slaughter them. Those who violate this prohibition will be sent to officials for punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth prohibition: During annual duck raising, women are not permitted to dig and hoe around the front, back, left and right of terraces. Violators will be fined three taels of silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tablet content includes protecting mountain forests, protecting village residential environments, prohibiting indiscriminate cutting, and regulating forestry market order. Through \"severe governance,\" it achieved prominent results and became one of the influential \"self-governance codes\" in the Qingshui River basin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tree planting and afforestation to protect forest resources is the most common measure and means for Qingshui River forest area residents to create livable environments. People organized forces to supervise the implementation of tablet \"regulations,\" making them \"local customary law\" with mandatory binding force. The over 600 ancient trees that still stand tall and verdant in Wendou Miao Village today are the best interpretation of this ecological concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The middle and lower reaches of the Qingshui River have been Guizhou's largest timber distribution center and timber trading center since the Ming and Qing dynasties. Sanmentang, Benchu, and Qinglang in Tianzhu County were called the \"Outer Three Rivers,\" while Maoping, Wangzhai, and Guazhi in Jinping County were known as the \"Inner Three Rivers.\" All were once prosperous docks where \"timber rafts covered the river, with thousands of cables crisscrossing.\" Guazhi, as one of the traditional timber trading center markets of the Qingshui River, has nearly 10 ancient \"River Regulations\" tablets regulating timber market behavior. The ancient tablet \"Yishi Yongzun\" (Generations of Eternal Compliance) is one of the surviving \"River Regulations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second year of Emperor Jiaqing's reign (1797), the most powerful Anhui, Jiangxi Linjiang, and Shaanxi timber merchant associations in the Qingshui River timber trade \"jointly consulted with the host families (Guazhi timber merchant households and management institutions)\" to establish \"River Regulations\" boundary markers at the Guazhi dock on the Qingshui River. They stipulated the business rights and limits of \"mountain merchants\" (local mountain dealers) and \"water merchants\" (external timber merchants, also called \"downstream buyers\"), and clarified the relevant rules for timber trade in the \"upper river\" and \"lower river\" of the Qingshui River. The \"Yishi Yongzun\" tablet text reads: The Hui, Lin, and Xi three associations jointly consult with host families and议定, this boundary marker: above shall forever be for mountain dealers to moor timber, downstream buyers shall not stop rafts. Respectfully for eternal compliance, not to be disrupted or occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tablet text is carved on a boulder by the river. The \"River Regulations\" on one hand used mandatory management methods to protect the procurement interests of timber merchants, and on the other hand more broadly protected the interests of local forest farmers and the raft-floating group \"raft workers,\" ensuring that everyone's survival rights, business rights, and development rights were guaranteed while living in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Feishan Temple in Jinping County preserves a stone tablet of \"Eight-Step River Regulations\" from the ninth year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1883). The tablet text stipulates that along the Qingshui River tributary Liang River, from the \"first step\" village to the \"eighth step\" village, timber should be floated \"step by step,\" with each taking their profit. By dividing the connecting water surfaces between each \"river step,\" it clarified and guaranteed the river sections that different villages were respectively responsible for floating timber, ultimately determining their respective profits. The tablet content embodies the spirit of ethnic unity in sharing green mountains and clear waters resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Integrity and Propriety, Harmonious Governance**\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of all ethnic groups in southeastern Guizhou have traditionally \"lived off mountains while nurturing mountains,\" considering afforestation, timber sales, and fair trade as the foundation of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the entrance of Jinzong Village at the border between Nanjia Town in Jianhe County and Hekou Township in Jinping County, under ancient trees, stands an ancient tablet called \"Wangu Buxiu\" (Eternally Imperishable) erected in the 51st year of Emperor Qianlong's reign (1786), recording the division of timber from Wuzu Mountain. This contract carved on the stone tablet emphasizes that villagers share benefits equally and harmoniously share mountain forests. The tablet text reads: It is said that starting from the beginning is especially valuable for cultivation to the end. Our ancestors have lived on this land for generations, originally called Jianzong Village, with no other surnames, only the Pan and Fan surnames. After collective consultation, regarding the public land from Wuzu, Wupo, and above Wujujia Creek, all timber planted before and after, regardless of size, shall be divided into ten equal shares. The villagers and landowners occupy one share to preserve, while the public planters get nine shares. When they mature in the future, regardless of private cutting, landowners must be invited to sell together, without pursuing照依, no increase or decrease allowed. Thus having beginning and end, not betraying ancestors' legacy, descendants will naturally prosper.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tablet \"regulation\" not only maintained relationships within village clan groups but also maintained relationships between humans and nature. Villagers worship this ancient tablet during festivals, thanking predecessors for establishing rules that guaranteed the livelihood sources of village people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the ancient tablets preserved in the Qingshui River basin, there are many textual expressions with ecological and environmental development concepts: \"preserve and prohibit ancient trees to cultivate feng shui,\" \"stipulate that from the new first month, each household shall plant twenty feng shui trees, carved in stone prohibiting cutting,\" \"our local area entirely depends on cedar and tea for livelihood, fire is not permitted to destroy mountain fields, if discovered, public penalty\"... These words on tablets are the \"golden key\" to unlocking the code of clear mountains and beautiful waters in the Qingshui River forest area.\n",

For example, Aier Eye Hospital received another increase from Ge Lan in the fourth quarter. As of October 24 this year, CEIBS Healthcare Mixed Fund held a total of 263 million shares of Aier Eye Hospital, accounting for 2.82% of its total share capital. Financial reports show that from 2020 to 2022, Aier Eye Hospital's total operating revenue was 11.912 billion yuan, 15.001 billion yuan, and 16.11 billion yuan respectively, with net profit attributable to parent company of 1.724 billion yuan, 2.323 billion yuan, and 2.524 billion yuan respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Under the trends of aging population and consumption upgrades, the sustained growth of China's consumer medical demand has relative certainty. A high-quality, diversified, multi-level medical system requires the participation and supplementation of social medical care. Medical services have long been in short supply in China, and private medical institutions are a powerful supplement to public medical institutions,\" said Zhu Mingrui, fund manager at Nord Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhu Mingrui said that over the past two years, medical institutions have been affected by patient flow controls leading to performance fluctuations, as well as policies such as medical service price reforms, centralized procurement, and DRG promotion, causing the consumer medical sector's valuation to continue declining. With the continued recovery of the domestic economy, the performance of the consumer medical sector may gradually be validated, and the impact of related policies may gradually become clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Zhu Mingrui's view, the innovative drug sector is currently experiencing a critical period of transition from rapid imitation to differentiated innovation development. From a policy perspective, innovation remains an eternal theme, and policy changes from the payment side to the review side all show policy encouragement and guidance for differentiated innovation. In terms of medical insurance, the 2022 medical insurance negotiation rules first proposed simplified renewal rules, providing simplified renewal for exclusive products where actual medical insurance fund expenditure during the agreement period did not exceed 200% of the estimated value and future budget increases are expected to be reasonable, with tiered price reductions based on the proportion of actual expenditure exceeding estimated values. Under the new rules, differentiated innovative products may often have opportunities to obtain greater bargaining space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guotai Junan also pointed out that with rising approval standards and climbing industry learning curves, China's innovative drugs are moving from a \"quantitative change\" era to a \"qualitative change\" era. Some new drugs are showing greater clinical benefit potential, and domestic new drug BD overseas licensing and overseas approval listings are successively being realized. Currently, innovative drug companies' new drug revenues are rapidly scaling up, R&D and sales expense indicators are improving, profitability is enhancing, and commercialization is entering an accelerated harvest period. It is recommended to preferentially select segment leaders with stable main businesses and overseas business breakthroughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaiyuan Securities stated in its research report that looking ahead to 2024, on the supply side of pharmaceuticals and biological products, domestic innovative drug blockbusters are emerging and successively entering commercialization stages. With the advancement of innovative drug commercialization, related companies can quickly recover cash, which is expected to promote the development of subsequent R&D pipelines and gradually enter a virtuous development stage. In terms of the innovative drug industry chain, overall differentiation is evident, overseas demand is gradually stabilizing, and domestic demand awaits improvement. It also looks favorably upon medical imaging equipment and hemodialysis equipment tracks, as well as the traditional Chinese medicine sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhu Mingrui also believes that China's medical device market's domestic demand remains strong, with considerable room for improvement in the drug-to-device ratio. For the equipment sector within medical devices, in product areas with extremely high technical barriers such as PET-CT, flexible endoscopes, and rigid endoscopes, domestic penetration rates are still less than 10%, with enormous improvement potential. Domestically competitive companies are actively laying out second growth curves, striving to advance from segment leaders to platform companies. Similar to pharmaceutical companies, local medical device companies are also actively exploring new products and new business segments, seeking the next highlight for company growth, with domestic leaders expected to achieve \"the strong getting stronger.\"\n",

      "■ Luo Song  Yang Yao\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a highland canyon city in Sichuan Province famous for its love songs—Kangding. However, the Kangding Seismological Station of the Sichuan Provincial Seismological Bureau located on the northern outskirts of Kangding is little known. For 12 years, Tibetan girl Luojin Kangzhu has been engaged in the underground fluid (hot spring) and crustal deformation macroscopic observation here, and she has long regarded this place as her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, after working for 10 years at the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Song and Dance Troupe, Kangzhu had the opportunity to transfer jobs. She voluntarily applied to work at the Kangding Seismological Station. \"My father was the first generation of seismologists at the Sichuan Provincial Seismological Station. When I was young, I often followed him to collect water samples. He treated the observation data as more important than himself, and he never missed a day, no matter the weather. Under his influence, I have always been full of yearning and longing for the cause of seismology, secretly vowing that I would also engage in seismological observation work in the future,\" said Luojin Kangzhu.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she first arrived at the seismological station, Luojin Kangzhu not only had difficulty adapting but also did not know where to start. Her colleagues told her, \"It doesn't matter if you don't know how; you are young and can learn quickly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample data preprocessing, instrument calibration, instrument maintenance, and abnormal verification report writing... Under the encouragement of her colleagues, Luojin Kangzhu started from scratch and worked hard to learn. She practiced replacing the recording paper of the deformation observation instrument installed in a cave, which had to be done in the dark because it could not be exposed to light. \"First, I practiced blindfolded in the office for a month, and then I learned from my colleagues for another month before I could replace the paper independently.\" Although the station had undergone digital transformation a few years ago, this experience remains vivid in Luojin Kangzhu's memory to this day. As the seasons changed, the diligent and eager-to-learn Luojin Kangzhu quickly became the station's \"observation expert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In early March, Kangding was still cold. Just after 7 a.m., at the end of a country road, after walking about 600 meters up a steep slope, Luojin Kangzhu arrived at a small house on the mountainside. She gently pushed open the iron gate and skillfully measured the water temperature in the cramped Longtougou Hot Spring Observation Point. She collected water samples in prepared test tubes and collected air samples in gas collection bottles. She carefully packaged the samples, checked that the surrounding environment was normal, and then returned to the roadside along the original path. She walked 2 kilometers to the nearest bus stop, took the bus back to the station, and proceeded with the next step of processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Water sampling has strict requirements for flow rate, which must not be too fast or too slow, and the bubbles in the water sample must also meet the requirements. It took me more than a year to master this technique,\" Luojin Kangzhu said proudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Kangding. During this period, Luojin Kangzhu took on the task of hot spring observation sampling, walking 11 kilometers to and from the Longtougou Hot Spring Observation Point every day for more than 10 days to collect water samples, providing scientific data for the command center to carry out earthquake prediction and forecasting work. She was called \"the Edelweiss of the Seismological Station.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce interference, earthquake hot spring monitoring points are generally chosen in remote, high, and steep locations far from human habitation. This makes data collection and equipment maintenance even more difficult. However, Luojin Kangzhu did not retreat. No matter how cold, windy, or snowy the plateau was in winter, she always arrived on time to collect samples, ensuring the timeliness, continuity, and reliability of the first-hand monitoring data.\n",
      "\n",
      "After completing the day's data processing, Luojin Kangzhu began her daily inspection work, checking the observation site, equipment, and surrounding environment six times a day and recording the results. After completing the last inspection of the day, it was already late at night. The sleepless Luojin Kangzhu strolled to the bank of the Yala River. Looking at the quiet Kangding city across the river at this moment, Luojin Kangzhu recalled her father's words: \"Actually, what we do is to ensure the continuity of observation to the greatest extent, because this is how we can guarantee the original reliability of the data and ensure the safety of people's lives.\" On her way back, Luojin Kangzhu saw that the edelweiss by the roadside had quietly bloomed, swaying gracefully in the lamplight, beautiful and moving.\n",

      "Students are not allowed to be assigned simple repetitive labor or high-intensity labor unrelated to their major; they are not allowed to be arranged, managed, and organized through intermediary agencies or paid agencies for internship work; they are not allowed to be assigned overtime or night shifts; the internship remuneration for students should not be lower than 80% of the wage standard for the same position in the unit or the minimum wage standard, and the payment cycle should not exceed one month... Recently, the Ministry of Education, together with eight other departments, deeply analyzed the new situation of job upgrading and changes in occupational scenarios under the background of the digital economy, and, with a focus on the entire process of internships, revised the \"Regulations on the Management of Internships for Vocational School Students\" issued in 2016. The revision further clarified the behavioral norms for student internships and drew a \"red line\" for internship management. (See January 23, \"Wenhui Daily\")\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, from the national to the local level, there has been great concern about the problems that have arisen during the internships of vocational school students, and measures have been taken to correct them. However, the problems with vocational school internships have not been fundamentally resolved. According to media reports, a 15-year-old girl named Xiao Chen from Haikou and 27 other students enrolled in a vocational school in Hainan, but after arriving at the school, they were taken to a factory in Guangdong to become ordinary workers on the assembly line. Eight months later, when the students went to the school to request a refund and withdrawal, they were told that they had no student status, and most of their wages during the work period were also withheld. Such cases of organizing students to work on the production \"assembly line\" under the guise of internships, even arranging overtime and night shifts, forced internships, paid internships, and internships that do not match their major, have occurred from time to time. In this sense, the \"red line\" drawn for internship management can better protect students' rights and interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newly revised \"Regulations on the Management of Internships for Vocational School Students\" is about drawing \"red lines.\" According to the \"Regulations,\" students have the right to choose their internships autonomously, have the right to be informed, and avoid intermediary intervention. Students' internship insurance will also be fully covered. If problems arise, legal penalties will be imposed, cutting off the root of interest entanglements. However, to truly implement the regulations, more in-depth and detailed work is needed. On the one hand, efforts should be made to help students and parents improve their awareness of rights protection, know how to protect their rights, and be clear about the methods and ways to protect their rights. In reality, the path of students' rights protection is not smooth. Students' grasp of legal knowledge is not comprehensive, and they may be obstructed by relevant vested interests. Parents may also face the problem of \"not knowing.\" This requires comprehensive publicity to \"teach\" students how to protect their own rights and interests. On the other hand, competent departments must actively intervene, carry out special investigations and key inspections, combine undercover investigations with reports, and deal with the relevant responsible parties in accordance with the law and regulations.\n",

      "Shanghai Library currently holds 57 million items, most of which can be accessed at the Huaihai Road Branch. Readers can obtain documents or consult librarians based on their needs in different service areas. In terms of professional services, the Huaihai Road Branch caters to research needs, offering multiple stable solutions. For example, despite being closed for most of the past year, interlibrary loan and document delivery services still processed nearly 40,000 items, while clipping services provided nearly 4,000 issues without interruption.\n",

CITIC Securities commented that the policy combination of \"unchanged 1-year LPR and reduced 5-year LPR\" aims to protect banks' net interest margins. Haitong Securities also noted that the policy will comprehensively consider the balance between residents' debt burden and banks' profitability, with the market expecting marketization of deposit rates. As of the third quarter of 2023, the net interest margin of commercial banks had fallen to 1.73%, with significant pressure on interest margins. Although the bank deposit rates were cut again at the end of last year, considering the time lag in the adjustment of term deposit rates and the intensifying trend of deposit termization, the cost pressure on the liability side of banks remains significant. Haitong Securities speculated that the central bank may continue to promote deposit rate reforms to further reduce the cost of liabilities for financial institutions, easing the pressure on net interest margins.\n",

      "The number of online scams continues to rise. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently revealed that it received 954 complaints related to bank fraud in the first nine months of this year, already surpassing last year's total of 555 cases. To prevent such incidents, the HKMA has introduced 10 measures to enhance e-banking security, including multi-factor authentication, notifications for suspicious account activities, and the ability to quickly suspend e-banking accounts. The HKMA has issued guidelines to banks, requiring them to fully implement these new arrangements by next March.\n",
      "\n",
      "HKMA Assistant General Manager (Banking Supervision) Chan King-wah said that the HKMA has been monitoring both international and local scam situations, regularly sharing relevant tactics and preventive measures with the banking industry to ensure that banks' risk management measures keep pace with the times and protect customers' interests. He hopes that banks will continue to enhance their anti-fraud capabilities and, in the event of a scam, be able to quickly strengthen relevant control measures to plug loopholes, just as the anti-counterfeiting features of banknotes need to be continuously strengthened to counter ever-evolving counterfeiting technologies.\n",

      "According to the latest police data, there were 15,000 cases of cybercrime in the first half of this year, a 47% increase compared to the same period last year. However, there were only a few cases of local e-banking accounts being manipulated. Nevertheless, Chan King-wah pointed out that the HKMA has noticed an increase in similar scams in many overseas regions. For example, scammers write malicious programs (malware) targeting the Android operating system, tricking the public into downloading and installing them via links or QR codes. Once installed, these programs can record customers' e-banking passwords and read one-time SMS verification codes, but customers are often unaware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chan King-wah said that the current e-banking guidelines already include requirements to prevent malicious programs. For example, banks must check the security status of customers' mobile devices before providing e-banking services, such as whether the device has been \"jailbroken\" or shows signs of having malicious programs installed. If the device is not secure, the bank should not provide the relevant services. Additionally, if the bank's mobile application offers important functions such as mobile security code generators, it must further strengthen security measures to prevent malicious programs, such as checking whether the phone screen is being recorded by malicious programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic Monitoring to Identify Suspicious Accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "While the current e-banking guidelines already include requirements to prevent malicious programs, Chan King-wah hopes to proactively enhance e-banking security to prevent similar scams from occurring locally, making it more difficult for scammers to target local customers. The new measures focus on strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activities or transactions, identity verification, and customer notifications. Key measures include establishing a dynamic fraud monitoring mechanism that more comprehensively considers customers' past transaction patterns and data to quickly identify suspicious account activities. When detecting unusual account activities or high-risk transactions, banks should require customers to undergo surprise identity verification or add an additional layer of authentication beyond dual-factor authentication to confirm that the account is not being operated by someone else. In addition to high-risk transactions, banks should also notify customers of any unusual account activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, when customers suspected their credit cards were being misused, they were unable to immediately contact the bank to suspend the service. The HKMA will require banks to set up a dedicated hotline or e-banking platform to immediately suspend e-banking or credit card accounts and prevent multiple devices from logging into the same e-banking account at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked whether measures such as surprise and additional identity verification would affect customers' convenience and experience in using banking services, Chan King-wah said that it is necessary to balance account security and risk. He emphasized that not every transaction will require additional identity verification, only suspicious or high-risk transactions will trigger such requirements, and it will not significantly impact customers' usage.\n",

      "\"Subletting\", \"short-term rental scams\"... In recent years, the real estate rental market has been very active, but various problems and disputes have frequently occurred. At this year's Shanghai Two Sessions, People's Congress representative Peng Yanling proposed a motion to amend the \"Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Regulations\" to provide legal regulation for the real estate rental market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current situation: rental chaos causes many conflicts\n",
      "Representative Peng Yanling pointed out that housing rental is related to people's livelihood, social stability, and urban development. In recent years, with the continuous development of the housing rental market in the city, the housing rental industry has grown rapidly, housing rental models have been continuously innovated, continuously meeting the needs of the housing rental market, promoting the prosperity and development of the market. However, due to the defects and shortcomings in housing rental management, it has to some extent affected the healthy development of the housing rental market and the level of fine urban management.\n",
      "\n",
      "She analyzed that first, housing rental management has not been fully covered. According to the \"Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Regulations\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Regulations\"), housing rental activities in the city are subject to the adjustment of the \"Regulations\" and are managed in accordance with the law. Housing rental management should include both the management of directly managed public rental housing and the management of commercial housing rental, but in actual work, the management of directly managed public housing is relatively orderly and smooth, while the coverage of commercial housing rental management is low, and there are many problems, affecting the management effect. In addition, the rental of houses on rural homesteads has not been included in the management for a long time, and there are also many problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, housing rental management methods are single. For many years, the city's approach to housing rental management has been dominated by civil legal relationships between the parties, with relatively simple and single management methods, mainly the model contract text system and rental registration and filing system. Due to the lack of restraint and constraint measures and methods, a large number of hidden rental markets that have not been registered and filed by the management department exist, causing many problems and disputes, and subletting and other situations occur from time to time, affecting the healthy development of the rental market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, some new situations and problems lack normative basis. With the continuous activation of Shanghai's tourism market, the phenomenon of residents' houses being converted into homestays and short-term rentals is becoming more and more common, and how to manage them faces a lack of basis; how to protect the housing rights of low-income migrant workers also needs to be further studied, otherwise, the subletting problem cannot be fundamentally eliminated; the supervision of long-term rental apartment rental service enterprises needs to be further strengthened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amend the law to ensure the residential nature of housing\n",
      "\"Houses are for living in, not for speculation.\" Representative Peng Yanling said, \"The Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan\" clearly pointed out that it is necessary to effectively activate the stock of housing resources, expand the supply of urban rental housing in a powerful and orderly manner, improve the long-term rental housing policy, and gradually make rental and purchase housing enjoy equal rights in enjoying public services; accelerate the construction of housing rental legislation, strengthen the supervision of the rental market, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of tenants and landlords.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At present, on the one hand, the state has clear instructions and requirements for the construction and management of the housing rental market.\" Representative Peng Yanling analyzed that on the other hand, due to the early formulation of the \"Regulations\", some normative contents and management measures are no longer adapted to the development of the situation and the needs of management requirements, and the problems of insufficient and insufficient support for housing rental management basis need to be paid attention to, and should be supplemented and improved in accordance with the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason, Representative Peng Yanling suggested that through the revision of the \"Regulations\", the top-level design of housing rental in the city should be reshaped, and the implementation of the spirit of the Party Central Committee's \"housing is for living, not for speculation\" should be further fully implemented, and a perfect housing rental management system should be established to promote the healthy development of the rental market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representative Peng Yanling suggested that the scope of application of the \"Regulations\" should be further clarified, and the management object scope should cover the management of market-oriented rental (commercial housing rental), public housing rental and affordable rental housing management, forming a housing rental management system. At the same time, in combination with the actual law enforcement management, the beneficial systems formed in the process of promoting the development of market-oriented rental and affordable rental housing in recent years should be solidified through the revision of the regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, she suggested to establish a rental rights protection system and implement the purchase and rental together. Further scientifically establish a rental rights protection system. Through the revision of the \"Regulations\", it is clear that in some matters or social public policies, the \"rental and purchase with equal rights\" is implemented, and some policies implemented are legalized. \"It is clear that the children of tenants who meet the conditions enjoy the right to public services such as nearby schooling, and ensure the equal rights of rental and purchase; increase the support of housing provident fund for rental housing. Workers who meet certain conditions can apply for the withdrawal of a certain amount of housing provident fund with the rental contract filing certificate to pay the rent.\" Representative Peng Yanling also emphasized the need to protect the stable housing rights of tenants, and through the legal regulation of contents such as rental period and rental price adjustment mechanism, and clarify that tenants have equal rights to parking in the community, and stabilize the rental rights.\n",

      "To help new urban residents, young people, especially those engaged in basic public services, and other groups with housing difficulties achieve \"having a place to live,\" in 2021, 40 key cities with large population inflows secured 942,000 units of affordable rental housing, which is expected to solve the housing difficulties of nearly 3 million new urban residents and young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among them, 70% of the affordable rental housing was built using existing land and buildings, without changing the nature of land use or requiring the payment of additional land fees, which created conditions for reducing the price of affordable rental housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to rent, for projects that use non-residential existing land and buildings to build affordable rental housing, after obtaining the recognition certificate for affordable rental housing projects, water, electricity, and gas prices can be uniformly implemented at residential prices to further reduce living costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that this year, 2.4 million units of affordable rental housing will be newly secured nationwide. Key cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen have all increased the proportion of newly increased affordable rental housing, generally accounting for 40% to 45% of the newly increased housing supply.\n",

Through the renovation of old urban residential areas, the elderly can take the elevator downstairs to sunbathe, and the road for the disabled is no longer bumpy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only in cities, in 2021, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development promoted the implementation of dangerous housing renovation and seismic renovation for low-income groups in rural areas, with a total of 492,000 units renovated that year. Vice Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Zhang Xiaohong said that Yunnan, Qinghai, and other places have experienced earthquakes above magnitude 6, and the renovated houses have withstood the earthquake test, with no overall collapse and no casualties caused by house collapse, which are called \"life-saving houses\" by the public.\n",

      "In recent years, wireless phone chargers have gained popularity among consumers due to their convenience of not requiring plugging and unplugging data cables and simply placing the phone to charge. How do the performance and quality of wireless phone chargers, which claim to offer \"shell flash charging, intelligent matching compatibility, and high-efficiency low-temperature charging,\" fare? On July 23, the Shanghai Consumer Rights Protection Commission released the results of a comparative test of wireless phone chargers: 6 out of 18 samples, including those from Zhiguozhe and Newman Newmine, failed the foreign object detection test.\n",
      "\n",
      "6 samples failed the foreign object detection test\n",
      "It is understood that this comparative test purchased 18 wireless phone chargers through multiple e-commerce platforms, including 4 original chargers from Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, and Vivo, and 14 non-original chargers from brands such as Bull and Green Union. The prices of the samples ranged from 29.9 yuan to 329 yuan, with the average price of original samples being 289 yuan and non-original samples being 90 yuan.\n",
      "This comparative test focused on product safety and charging performance, testing the samples for heating, charging protection, and foreign object detection according to national standards. It also simulated real consumer usage scenarios to compare the charging time and transmission distance of different samples and examined the appearance and labels of the samples.\n",
      "The test found that in terms of safety, 6 out of 18 samples failed the foreign object detection test. This comparative test conducted safety testing on the samples according to the mandatory national standard GB 4943.1—2022. It was found that all 18 samples met the standards for heating and charging protection, with the highest temperature during charging ranging from 29.7 to 67.0°C, and all samples automatically switched to low-power mode after being fully charged. However, 6 samples failed the foreign object detection test and could not effectively detect the proximity of metal foreign objects and stop charging, causing the temperature of the foreign objects to exceed the standard limit. For example, the wireless charger with the claimed manufacturer/agent as Guangzhou Feishi Electronics Technology Co., Ltd./Shenzhen Yuncheng Technology Co., Ltd., with the brand name Zhiguozhe, model number WX1-Black, and production date of 2023.12.13; the 15W wireless charger with the claimed manufacturer/agent as Beijing Newman Tengfei Technology Co., Ltd., with the brand name Newman Newmine, model number WXC01, and production date of 2023.12, etc. These 6 samples that failed the safety test were not included in the performance comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original chargers of domestic phones have higher power\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Rights Protection Commission pointed out that charging time is one of the most important performance indicators for consumers, and the length of charging time is closely related to the power of the charger. Among the 12 samples that passed the safety test, 3 had a power of 50W, 6 had a power of 15W, and 3 had a power of 10W. The test found that original chargers all used private protocols, and for their respective models, the three samples from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo could all provide 50W charging, while Apple could provide 15W charging. Non-original chargers could only execute open protocols, with power mostly between 10W and 20W.\n",
      "Generally, the higher the power, the shorter the charging time. This comparative test simulated real consumer usage scenarios and observed the time it took for the samples to charge the load machine from 0% to 100%. The test found that when the original chargers were used with their respective brand's fast-charging models, the charging time for the three samples from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo was all within 2 hours, with Huawei taking only 64 minutes, the best performance; Apple took approximately 2.7 hours. When Huawei and Apple swapped chargers, the 50W wireless charger from Huawei charged the Apple phone at a power of 11W, taking approximately 2.9 hours; the 15W wireless charger from Apple charged the Huawei phone at a power of 6.8W, taking nearly 5 hours.\n",
      "For the 8 non-original chargers, the test uniformly selected two popular phones (HUAWEI P60 and iPhone 14) as load machines and found that the charging time of the 8 samples varied significantly, averaging 3 to 5 hours. Among them, the charging time for the HUAWEI P60 load machine ranged from 2 hours 47 minutes to 5 hours 35 minutes, and the charging time for the iPhone 14 load machine ranged from 2 hours 58 minutes to 4 hours 32 minutes. The ZMI, Green Union, and Yise samples performed well, with charging times for both load machines within 3 hours.\n",
      "The test found that to reduce battery wear, some chargers and phones have the function of automatically adjusting the charging power, such as first fast charging at high power to 90%, then switching to slow trickle charging to 100%.\n",
      "In addition, not having to remove the phone case and supporting \"case charging\" is a major selling point of wireless chargers. This comparative test selected two common phone cases for verification testing and also used A4 paper to simulate a phone case, testing the maximum thickness of A4 paper that could be placed between the phone and the wireless charger in a charging state as the maximum transmission distance of the sample. The test found that all 12 samples could \"charge with a case,\" with a maximum transmission distance ranging from 3.9 millimeters to 7.6 millimeters, averaging 6.0 millimeters. Among them, the maximum transmission distance of 4 original chargers was all above 6.0 millimeters.\n",
      "Finally, the test also conducted verification testing on the radiation issue that consumers are concerned about and found that the radiation values of all tested samples were within the standard limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "● Consumer Reminder\n",
      "Choose original products for better \"fast charging\"\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Rights Protection Commission reminds consumers that when selecting a wireless charger, they should pay attention to the power of the charger and the power supported by the phone. The actual charging power is based on the lower of the two, with matching being the best. Due to protocol restrictions, 50W high-power chargers are mostly original products for phones, which can achieve fast charging for the corresponding models of the same brand, while non-original products' so-called \"fast charging\" can mostly only reach a maximum power of 15W.\n",
      "Original products for phones charge faster but are more expensive, while non-original products charge slower but are cheaper. It is recommended to choose according to your own needs. The outer packaging label of the product should indicate the manufacturer's name, maximum power, model number, etc. You can carefully check by looking at the appearance and smelling the odor to ensure that there are no gaps or odors.\n",
      "Choosing a charger with a cooling fan and good heat dissipation can avoid the charging power being limited by the temperature control system due to high temperature, thus ensuring charging efficiency. Magnetic objects (such as the magnetic strips or chips of credit cards and smart keys) placed nearby may cause product damage and also affect the performance of the charger. It is recommended to avoid placing magnetic or metal objects on the surface of the charger for a long time to prevent device overheating or malfunction. (Liu Hao)\n",

      "\"The bright future of the Xinjiang Pilot Free Trade Zone is worth looking forward to!\" At the meeting, every standing committee member and committee member cherished beautiful expectations for Xinjiang's high-quality development. The spark of pioneering and innovative exploration is quietly ignited, the tide of development surges forward, and the sound of commercial vehicles and pastoral songs intertwine in the desert and oases... It is believed that the Xinjiang Pilot Free Trade Zone will prove to the world with fruitful results that \"China's door of opening-up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.\"\n",

      "From the 2630-point rebound, in four weeks, people have become accustomed to making money while lying down, thinking it is their own ability to deserve. By 3050 points, considering the new shares issued over the past year, this position is similar to the 3400-point position at this time last year. It has already reached the limit of the height that the existing funds can maintain. At this time, if there is no large amount of incremental funds entering the market, the daily turnover of 1.1 trillion yuan can only barely maintain the index from a big drop. The government releases news every day to stir up the wind and fire, preventing funds from gathering, hoping for a fair distribution of rain and dew, and just stabilizing the situation. At this stage, it is impossible to allow a clear main theme like Sora and new quality production to appear. Without a clear main theme, there is no continuity of the sector, and without continuity, the profit you make today will be lost tomorrow. This electric fan-like rotation will make it impossible for people to make money through short-term speculation. The government believes that since the short-term ecology has been made to lose money, if you want to make money in the stock market, there is only one way: to become a medium- and long-term investor and not move. If everything were that simple. If the large short-term funds continue to lose money, they will withdraw and go empty-handed, or use the selling frenzy to guide the emotions of retail investors, constantly creating a downward trend, and then profit from the rebound within the downward trend. Because if it is not possible to rise, and it is not possible to make money from the rising market, then the only way to make money is to create a downward trend. Although there is no short-selling mechanism on the A-share market, large funds have means to profit from short-selling. For example, securities lending. For example, quantitative trading. For example, information asymmetry, small essays. On Monday of this week, Ningde Times led the new energy sector to explode, and on Tuesday it died. On Tuesday of this week, the low-altitude economy sector exploded, and on Wednesday it died. On Wednesday of this week, the media and gaming sector exploded, and on Thursday it died. On Thursday of this week, the innovative drug sector exploded, and on Friday it is unknown. On Friday of this week, it is unknown. Every day there are sectors trying to break out, but these sectors die the next day without making a sound. Why? Compared to the above rotating sectors, algorithm centers and automobiles can be said to have some continuity. Last night I slept late, thinking about the future of automobiles. Two weeks ago, I concluded through summarizing all the policy landing rhythms that the only sector the government hopes to explode is new energy vehicles. Whether it is the representative of heavy industry, new quality production, or the application end of AI technology, it will eventually become automobiles. This year, Seres even heavily advertised and appeared on the Spring Festival Gala. Then the stock price broke the previous high of the end of last October. If I were a capital institution with hundreds of billions of assets to play the stock market, I think, apart from buying Seres, there is no other choice. I buy Seres for 10 billion yuan, eat a limit up and make 1 billion yuan. I have to eat 30 limit ups on Kelai Machine to make this 1 billion yuan. Eating a double in Seres is equivalent to my year of running around. The deposit for a Huawei AITO car is 5,000 yuan. If necessary, I can spend 100 million yuan to disperse across the country to book 20,000 cars to boost sales. I don't want the car, and I will cancel the order later, not taking back the 100 million yuan deposit. I just want the sales data. As long as there is this better-than-expected sales data, and then let the media hype it up. Seres' stock price will have a limit up, and I can make 10 billion yuan. If it can have two or three limit ups, my nine generations will have food and clothing. Therefore, we often see mainstream financial news saying that Seres has booked how many cars this month, which does not mean how many cars are actually sold. We also rarely see Huawei AITO on the road. In order to make Seres' stock price continue to rise, I must also maintain the popularity of the automobile sector. It is well known that the continuity of the sector is driven by news stimulation and the emotional leading of the limit-up leading stocks, such as the relationship between Kelai Machine and new quality production. If I want the automobile sector to break out with continuity, there are only two methods. 1. Let the government keep issuing documents to stimulate the automobile industry. I don't need to worry about this, because they are originally going to do this. Because apart from the export of electric vehicles and the replacement of electric vehicles, they have no other means to save the economy. The media is the wind machine for creating a wind. What is unmanned driving, flying cars, low-altitude economy, Huawei intelligent driving, all are for selling cars. Similar to the flowery language of a salesman. 2. Create an emotional limit-up leading stock to lead the automobile sector to break out. Similar to the 14 limit-ups of Shenglong Share in October last year, if Shenglong is not enough, then Tianlong Share can have 10 limit-ups, Dong'an Power can have 9 limit-ups. As long as this leading stock can stir up the continuous heat of the automobile sector, Seres will continue to rise with the wind. Seres may need a month to rise 40%, which can bring me a profit of 60 billion yuan. It is worth spending 100 million yuan to hire an operator to create two limit-up leading stocks in the automobile sector. Since retail investors believe in Yangjia Alliance Master and Hujiang Lou, can my operators use their seats to create leading stocks? It is terrifying to think carefully, because, if you look at the ecological structure of the stock market from this capital perspective. The food chain of each link, such as the government, the industry, the media, the institutions, the game capital, and the major shareholders, can all make profits, except for the retail investors. With this idea, today I ignored everything when watching the market, and the whole day was spent looking for small leading stocks in the automobile sector. 1. Xingguang Share 3 in 4 is doing lighting, which can only be said to be in the automobile electronics category. Can it be a leading stock in the automobile sector? It is not known yet, and there is no opportunity to participate. The traces of large funds are too obvious. Previously, Ai'ai Precision had 4 boards, and most people said it was the industrial chain and could not be participated in. The relay would die. However, it had two consecutive limit-ups, killing all opponents, and today it became the market's total leading stock with 8 boards. So, we cannot subjectively discriminate against such one-line boards, right? 2. Yingli Automobile 2 in 3 is a small automobile enterprise in Northeast China with a small market value. It is too small, with only 1.1 billion in circulation. Small means that the uncontrollability is too great. If the operator slips, he accidentally buys more than 5% of the market value, becomes a shareholder and is locked for 6 months without being allowed to sell, which would be very troublesome. Yingli's first board was made by Yangjia, and the second board was also maintained by him to go up. If it actively goes up to the third board today, it will be the leading stock of the automobile sector, on the premise of kicking out Xingguang. Unfortunately, I waited until the afternoon, and it was also trying to counterattack the board, but no one paid attention to it, and it was also powerless. 3. Dong'an Power 1 in 2 The remaining ones are the first boards of the automobile sector yesterday, which are Dong'an Power and Songzhi Share. Songzhi is for the automobile to do air conditioning, and Dong'an is to do the engine, and it is also an old dragon of the Huawei automobile concept. In the stage when Seres suddenly appeared in October last year, the emotional cycle dragon was also Shenglong Share ~ Tianlong Share ~ Dong'an Power, which was switched in this way. Now, it is also possible to switch back in reverse. Therefore, in the afternoon, I saw Dong'an Power's 2 boards, Tianlong Share's 1 board, and Shenglong's big rise. Personal operation: Give up Yingli Automobile, he failed to counterattack the board, and I cannot get a certain buying point, so I can only give up. Hit the board Dong'an Power, after the board is sorted out, 0.5 billion yuan of the seal is eaten in 5 minutes. Later, the funds also pulled up Tianlong's first board, Shenglong rose sharply, and stimulated Dong'an to seal again. Dong'an needs to continue to strengthen the connection tomorrow to attract the market, and actively enhance the leading stock quality of the automobile sector, suppressing Xingguang. If it cannot do this by itself, it can only let the big brother Shenglong and the second brother Tianlong come out to help. As for the result of tomorrow, it is really not possible to see it now. Since the funds pulled up Shenglong, Tianlong, and Dong'an today, they must be using these three old leading stocks of the automobile sector to rotate and stimulate the atmosphere of Huawei automobiles. Why do this? I think the only explanation is that they have placed a large number of preemptive positions in Seres, Wanfeng Aowei, and Jianghuai Automobile. Creating the emotional atmosphere of the automobile sector, as long as it can be maintained for four weeks, they can realize the return of doubling and earn hundreds of billions of profits. According to the logic I talked about, it is also reasonable to use it in the algorithm sector. It is certain that there are funds in the core large stocks of the algorithm sector such as Industrial Rich, Langchuan Information, Ziguang Guowei, and Zhongke Shuguang. Then, they go to maintain the stock price of Gaoxin Development, and create a small leading stock like Annai to drive the sector. As long as NVIDIA continues to rise, the algorithm will also rise. The construction of the AI algorithm center is like the real estate 20 years ago. Either you don't believe it, or you believe it early. Just treat it as a game of hot potato. Therefore, Industrial Rich and Gaoxin Development, in my eyes, are still at the foot of the mountain. There is a small problem temporarily. The performance of Industrial Rich is not good. There is an emotional negative news release causing the stock price to adjust. I remember that in the first half of last year, it grew by 1%, and now it has become a full-year growth of 4.82%, which is very stable. 2024 is the AI year, and its performance this year is the key. However, I said it's useless, people complain that the performance growth is too slow and too little. Value investors will calculate indicators and think that its current performance corresponds to a too high stock price, so they smash it. So its stock price fell, and then everyone will necessarily say that it is not good. The core of the algorithm sector, Gaoxin Development, is still in the horizontal adjustment and accumulation of strength, and\n",

As one of the major landmark projects for China to accelerate the construction of a transportation powerhouse, this tunnel will shorten the time to cross the Tian Shan Mountains from the original 3 hours to about 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 52-month construction process, the construction team faced challenges such as complex geological conditions. For the first time in domestic expressway tunnel construction, a hard rock tunnel boring machine (TBM) was applied, and the \"three tunnels + four vertical shafts\" construction method was pioneered to achieve \"long tunnel, short excavation,\" effectively saving construction time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a typical high-cold, high-altitude, and high-ground-stress long tunnel in domestic expressways, the Tian Shan Victory Tunnel runs through the central part of the Tian Shan Mountains, recording the hard work of the construction team.

      "**How to Cross the Geological Fault Zone?**\n",
      "**Shock Absorption and Energy Absorption, Precise Construction**\n",
      "On November 16, with the rotation of the cutterhead of the \"Tian Shan\" hard rock TBM, the \"Tian Shan\" successfully crossed the granite fault alteration zone. \"The continuous 14-month difficult breakthrough process was filled with hardships,\" said Huang Dengxian, chief engineer of the Fifth Section of the Wumai Expressway Project Department of CCCC, with a sigh of relief. \"The granite here is very fragile and crumbles at the slightest touch.\" Huang Dengxian recalled that during one excavation, the granite debris entangled the cutterhead, and the \"Tian Shan\" TBM, weighing over 2,800 tons, was trapped. The team made multiple attempts and finally managed to cross the fault alteration zone by opening a horizontal tunnel from the right tunnel to the front of the cutterhead of the central guide tunnel, manually drilling, blasting, and supporting the front, and then pushing the \"Tian Shan\" TBM through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huang Dengxian introduced that the entire tunnel needs to cross 16 geological fault zones, 12 of which are at the entrance end, with complex rock layers and weak geology. At the same time, the tunnel construction section is in a high ground stress environment, with the maximum ground stress value reaching nearly 22 megapascals. \"This is like constructing in 'tofu brain,' and there is a high possibility of encountering mud spouting and rock bursts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Teqiligen, the department head of the Fifth Section, has encountered such situations more than once. When the tunnel excavation reached 1,900 meters at the entrance end, the project encountered the largest fault zone, F6 Bo'a, with an impact width of 440 meters. The rock mass was broken and water-rich, making construction extremely difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hard rock TBMs are most afraid of encountering environments that are alternately soft and hard. In such environments, collapses and water inrushes are common, and sometimes the daily water discharge can reach 7,000 cubic meters,\" said Wu Teqiligen. Facing the possibility of collapses at any time, the team chose to strengthen support, fixing over 37,800 polyethylene foam concrete pipes firmly to the rock wall to form a 70-centimeter-thick foam concrete shock absorption layer, which alleviates the compressive force of the fault on the surrounding rock support. After 80 days of hard work, they successfully crossed the F6 Bo'a fault zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tian Shan Victory Tunnel project is the first project for Du Mingchen, the deputy director of the hard rock TBM team of the Fifth Section, since he started working. \"In the past four years, the difficulties we encountered were more and more challenging, but we have overcome them,\" said Du Mingchen. He mentioned that mud and water often flooded up to their waists, but with an unyielding spirit, the team overcame one difficulty after another in tunnel construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Shorten the Construction Period?**\n",
      "**\"Long Tunnel, Short Excavation\" Shortens the Effective Construction Period from 72 Months to 52 Months**\n",
      "Excavating two tunnels, each 22.13 kilometers long, in the Tian Shan Mountains would take an estimated 72 months of effective construction time using traditional drilling and blasting methods. However, to meet the needs of public travel and regional development, the project must be completed as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After repeated research and demonstration, we innovatively chose the 'main tunnel + central guide tunnel' excavation scheme,\" explained Miao Baodong, the chief engineer of the Wumai Project of CCCC. By adding a central guide tunnel between the left and right main tunnels, the hard rock TBM, independently developed by the China Communications Construction Group for the Tian Shan Victory Tunnel, acts as the \"vanguard,\" creating more working faces for the left and right tunnels. This is equivalent to \"slicing\" the main tunnel into multiple segments for simultaneous operation, achieving \"long tunnel, short excavation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Heqi, the project manager of the Fifth Section, had previously participated in the construction of the Dong Tian Shan long tunnel. This time, returning to the Tian Shan Mountains, he applied the hard rock TBM for the first time in domestic expressway tunnel construction, using a globally pioneering new pressure grouting method. He was also uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the huge rotating disc drives dozens of cutter heads to advance inch by inch, the rocks are crushed into debris. The two hard rock TBMs, \"Tian Shan\" and \"Victory,\" excavated simultaneously from the south and north sides of the Tian Shan Mountains towards the center. At their fastest, they advanced at a speed of 20 to 30 meters per day, more than five times the speed of manual excavation, shortening the construction period to 52 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovative solutions increased the excavation speed while also increasing the construction working faces. How to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the project became another challenge. \"During the peak construction period, there were seven working faces operating simultaneously at the exit end alone. In the deep and dark tunnel, more than 1,200 people entered and exited daily, and vehicles made six to seven hundred trips,\" said Li Yalong, the project manager of the Sixth Section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering the digital monitoring and command center, the number of construction personnel and vehicles inside the tunnel are clearly visible. \"To ensure the orderly entry and exit of personnel and vehicles in the tunnel, we have built an intelligent traffic dispatching system, vehicle positioning system, and personnel electronic access control system, using technology to empower the project construction,\" said Li Yalong.\n",
      "\n",
      "With excavation proceeding from both ends, how to ensure a smooth \"meeting\" inside the mountain? The guarantee comes from a special technical team—the precision survey team. At the entrance and exit ends, the precision survey team members conduct a joint survey every six months, measuring the plane control points and elevation control network to ensure that the direction does not deviate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Ventilate?**\n",
      "**Four Vertical Shafts, Creating the Tunnel's \"Respiratory System\"**\n",
      "The tunnel is extremely long, with a maximum burial depth exceeding 1,100 meters. During the peak construction period, the tunnel contains numerous pollutants such as blasting smoke, internal combustion engine exhaust, and vehicle dust. How to ventilate and remove smoke?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The original peak period fan configuration power reached 8,700 kilowatts, which not only increases the environmental burden but also causes the pollutants to float, affecting construction safety,\" said Mao Jinbo, the chief engineer of the Sixth Section. Facing the engineering conditions, he innovatively proposed the long-distance construction ventilation method of three tunnels and corridors, fully utilizing the hard rock TBM's advanced parallel central guide tunnel and vertical shafts as construction ventilation corridors. By optimizing the ventilation layout and fan configuration and precisely managing the processes, the fan configuration power was reduced to 2,400 kilowatts, effectively solving the ventilation difficulties of ultra-long tunnels and achieving energy saving and emission reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four pairs of ventilation shafts dug from the top of the Tian Shan Mountains will play the role of a \"chimney effect\" during the operation phase, becoming the \"respiratory system\" of the entire tunnel. Among them, the two shafts of No. 2 shaft have a depth of over 700 meters each, making them the deepest expressway shafts in the world. \"More than 30 workers have been stationed year-round in the extreme high-altitude environment,\" said Huang Dengxian. Combining the advantages of the domestic advanced eight-arm hydraulic umbrella drill, the team completed the excavation of the two shafts of No. 2 shaft in 788 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "To excavate the vertical shafts, the team designed and manufactured the world's first ultra-large and ultra-deep vertical shaft equipment for high-cold and high-altitude conditions, named \"Chuangyi No. 1.\" \"Chuangyi No. 1\" drilled downward, and the construction personnel used small excavators to load the debris in the hole into the hoisting bucket, which was then transported to the ground by lifting equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the tunnel entrance, the vertical shafts are at a higher altitude and have a more harsh environment, with constant snowfall and a very thick permafrost layer, with a pure ice layer of over 30 meters. \"There is a lot of snow on top, and the blizzard howls,\" said Yang Xin, who was soon assigned to No. 1 shaft after joining the project, serving as the team leader, living in a tent, and cooking with a pressure cooker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the many emergencies handled, an unexpected water inrush in the vertical shaft left a deep impression on Yang Xin. \"When drilling to a depth of over 570 meters, the vertical shaft encountered a water inrush. At that time, the underground temperature was over 10 degrees Celsius, and the temperature above the shaft was minus 30 degrees Celsius. When exiting the shaft, we had to act quickly, otherwise our clothes would freeze,\" recalled Yang Xin. He and the team members worked overtime for 39 consecutive days before finally resolving the emergency.\n",

      "**The Origin of Chinese Culture: The Chime Bells (Part One)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, at the first-floor lobby of the Beijing International Conference Center, people were captivated by a set of \"Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells\" displayed there. When Professor Feng Xinxin from the Wuhan Conservatory of Music played the piano next to the chime bells, the chime bells produced a melodious sound, sometimes slow and sometimes fast. This is a new set of chime bells developed by Yantai Haote Musical Instrument Co., Ltd. in collaboration with the Wuhan Conservatory of Music and the Hubei Provincial Museum. Based on the Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells, it was created using computer-integrated control technology and a general keyboard interface. The ancient chime bells have regained their vitality in the modern era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound, music, the melodious tones of China\n",
      "The chime bells are a large percussion instrument from ancient China, made of bronze, with flat, round bells of different sizes arranged in order of their pitch and suspended on a frame. Striking the bronze bells produces different musical notes, creating beautiful melodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to historical records and archaeological discoveries, China had chime bells as early as the Western Zhou Dynasty, which were usually composed of three bells of different sizes. From the late Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States Period, the number of chime bells gradually increased, with sets of nine and thirteen bells. In 1957, the first set of chime bells unearthed in the Chengyang City site in Xinyang, Henan, had thirteen bells, and musicians immediately performed \"The East Is Red\" using them. In 1978, a set of chime bells from the Warring States Period (around 433 BC) was excavated from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in Suizhou, Hubei. This is the most remarkable set of chime bells ever discovered. The size of this set of chime bells is so large that it can fill an entire stage in a concert hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chime bells, which had been dormant for thousands of years, now produce a melodious and lively rhythm. This is the sound of China. As Mencius said in \"Mencius: Wanzhang Xia\": \"Confucius is called the great synthesizer. The great synthesizer is one whose voice is like metal and whose vibrations are like jade.\" Here, the \"voice of metal\" refers to the sound of the chime bells. China is a country with a traditional culture of music and rituals, and as a national ritual instrument, the chime bells are a symbol of the nation's image. \"From a historical and cultural tradition perspective, saying that the sound of the chime bells is the sound of China is not an exaggeration at all,\" said Zhang Xiang, a researcher at the Hubei Provincial Museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of the chime bells marks that China's musical culture and casting technology had reached a very high level. It is 2,000 years earlier than the appearance of the twelve-tone equal temperament keyboard instruments in Europe. In particular, the discovery of the Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells has brought a wealth of information to people, rewriting the history of Chinese and world music.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in ancient times, the chime bells were a symbol of power and status, mainly used for court performances, and rarely spread among the common people. A set of Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells is so large that it requires at least five performers to play together, which to some extent restricts the traditional chime bells from appearing on the modern stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to better apply the traditional excellent culture of \"Chinese sound\" to the modern music stage has become a lifelong obsession for researchers of chime bell culture like Feng Guangsheng, the deputy director of the China Millennium Monument World Art Center. After 40 years of exploration, this obsession has finally come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bells, harps, a thousand years of love\n",
      "The Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells consist of 65 bronze chime bells, with a range spanning five octaves, only one octave less than a modern piano, and the central range has all 12 semitones. According to expert research, each bell in the chime bells can produce two different musical notes. As long as the marked positions on the bell are struck accurately, it can produce musical notes that meet a certain frequency. The entire set of chime bells can produce all the sounds of the black and white keys on a modern piano. The tuning frequency of this set of chime bells is 256.4 Hz, which is almost exactly the same as the frequency of the central \"C\" on today's pianos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining the 2,400-year-old Chinese chime bells with the 300-year-old Western piano is not a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, Yantai Haote Musical Instrument Company was researching how to apply the Western clock automatic timing system to Chinese pagoda clock timing. An expert suggested applying the technical principles to chime bell performances. Sun Dejin, the company's chairman, then led a team to Hubei Provincial Museum for investigation. To ensure the inheritance and development of the chime bells, the company decided to develop a new set of chime bells. \"During the development process, we encountered many problems in both technology and art. We specially consulted experts from the Wuhan Conservatory of Music who had studied the Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells. Finally, we jointly developed the new chime bells with the Hubei Provincial Museum and the Wuhan Conservatory of Music,\" said Sun Dejin. \"After six years and an investment of more than 20 million yuan, we finally succeeded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to different application scenarios, the new chime bells have two types: fixed stage display and mobile exhibition. They can be played manually with a keyboard or automatically controlled. As long as the music works are made in MIDI format, they can be automatically performed by the new chime bells.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The successful development of the new chime bells combines tradition and modernity, art and technology. In the future, the new chime bells will continue to be developed to combine keyboard operation and manual operation, retaining the beauty of traditional performance methods, and making the chime bells more convenient and accurate to participate in modern orchestra performances,\" said Li Youping, vice president of the Wuhan Conservatory of Music.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 18, at the \"New Chime Bells Project Scientific and Technological Achievement Evaluation Meeting,\" famous musicians such as Xu Peidong, former vice president of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, described their feelings about the new chime bells' research achievements as \"unexpected and shockingly impressive.\" The committee unanimously agreed that the new chime bells retain the bronze craftsmanship characteristics of the Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells, such as shape and patterns, inheriting the unique \"Chinese sound\" of traditional chime bells. At the same time, it is based on the current social music life and international cultural exchange needs. It adopts the international concert pitch standard and the twelve-tone equal temperament for pitch design and tuning. In particular, through the application of computer analysis and integrated control technology, the chime bells' performance has been reformed into a standardized instrument with each bell scientifically configured with a hammer and played according to instructions. The traditional chime bells, which were originally played by multiple performers holding hammers and sticks, have now evolved into an ordinary instrument that can be played by a wide range of pianists and electronic keyboard players using a general keyboard interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unlike the Marquis Yi of Zeng's Chime Bells, which require at least five people to play simultaneously, the new chime bells only require one person to play the piano keyboard, avoiding the pitch problems caused by different strengths of multiple performers. Moreover, it has broken through the limitation that chime bells can only play slow-tempo music. The soul of an instrument lies in its sound, and the new chime bells have inherited the sound of metal and stone,\" said Feng Guangsheng.\n",

      "China Calcium Carbide Network: Correspondent Tang Jin reports: Walking into the production site of Xinjiang Tianye Calcium Carbide Company, one can see a group of \"women warriors\" working in the control room 8 meters above the ground. Their petite figures operate large and heavy equipment, weaving a beautiful landscape in the calcium carbide production workshop. They are the crane operators on the calcium carbide production line, affectionately known as \"sky girls.\" After the calcium carbide is discharged, the hoist pulls the calcium carbide cart into the cooling workshop; the hot calcium carbide pot needs to be lifted to the cooling area for cooling; then the empty pot is placed on the cart for the next discharge; the cooled calcium carbide block needs to be lifted to the finished product area for stacking. They work in a cramped crane driver's cab of less than 2 square meters, lifting and positioning smoothly and accurately, and performing all operational steps seamlessly with standardized actions. Their exquisite skills are on full display. Their arms swing left and right thousands of times, and their wrists twist back and forth thousands of times, honing their unique skills of sharp eyes, quick hands, and a keen mind, ensuring efficient and stable production of calcium carbide. They are known as \"star sky girls\" in the company. As special equipment, every crane operator is well aware of the importance of cranes in the entire calcium carbide production process. Before each shift handover, they always arrive at the workplace 20 minutes early to conduct detailed inspections of the single and double clamps, mechanical equipment, safety protection devices, and other parts to ensure safe and stable operation of the equipment during their shift. They take their responsibilities seriously, and their actions match their promises. During operation, they strictly follow every safety operating procedure, and their strong sense of responsibility and meticulous work attitude are reflected in every detail. In recent years, the company's trade union has actively built a platform for crane operators to learn from each other, exchange technical skills, and showcase their talents, producing a large number of skilled operators and master craftsmen. \"Spring hides brocade in the wind, and the sun shines on jade.\" Although the calcium carbide \"sky girls\" do not have beautiful clothes, their Tianye blue uniforms highlight their sweet smiles; they do not have quiet working conditions, but the roar of the machines is the most beautiful melody accompanying them; they do not have the elegance and grace of sky girls, but they exude confidence and composure in the calcium carbide operation room. They do extraordinary things in ordinary positions, with their passion and dedication for work, loyalty and responsibility for the company, showcasing the style of modern Tianye women workers, and silently yet loudly interpreting the meaning of \"women are not inferior to men.\"\n",

      "\"I would like to share with you two research results from the Social Sciences Academy's Food and Drug Industry Development and Supervision Research Center.\" The first is a three-dimensional analysis model of food consumption, which includes \"choice preference,\" \"monetary expenditure,\" and \"physical structure.\" Zhang Yongjian focused on introducing the survey results of the \"choice preference\" part. The survey showed that, based on the preferences freely provided by consumers, the top 10 consumer preferences were: taste, safety, nutrition, health, additives, production/quality/flavor period, sugar, low-sugar oil, salt, fat, regulation, and zero additives. Zhang Yongjian said that the first preference is taste, which is 109.3% higher than the second preference of safety, indicating that \"taste is the hard truth\" in food choice preferences. Regarding food consumption, Zhang Yongjian believes that the substitutability, jumpiness, hard constraints of expenditure, and convenience of purchase will directly affect stickiness.\n",

      "At the scene, Zhang Yongjian shared the second research result, which is part of the results of the \"Chinese Food Industry Public Opinion and Brand Communication Research\" in 2023. The research showed that in 2023, the information related to the food field exceeded 160 million on nine major communication platforms. Among the 50 monitoring points, the top 10 in terms of information quantity were: health, green (food), food safety, nutrition, taste, protein, supervision, edible oil, fat or fat, and ready-to-eat meals. In addition, the center also used \"hot words\" to judge which aspects and contents the public opinion was concerned about. Among the 483 valid hot words, the top 10 were: product, market, enterprise, China, company, nutrition, food, brand, industry, and food safety. Zhang Yongjian also specially reminded of the 12 high-risk public opinion categories, links, and problems found in the research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Yongjian believes that there are many factors affecting innovation and development. For the current innovation and development of national food consumer brands, it is crucial to strengthen the understanding and judgment of the development and application of science and technology and to respond to related challenges. The significant increase in the contribution of science and technology is an important feature of the new development of the food industry. New sciences and technologies are continuously applied to multiple fields and links of food R&D, production, and market. Science and technology not only change the external environment of the food industry's development but also change the development model of the food industry and the management model of food enterprises. Therefore, we should be more proactive in embracing new technologies such as digitalization and artificial intelligence. Facing the new development momentum based on technological support, it is objectively necessary to adapt to the new development through multi-dimensional innovation. Multi-dimensional innovation is the core element of the new development of the food industry. The innovation in the new development is not about patching up, nor is it about short-term and emergency measures. It is an integrated innovation based on new environment, new concepts, new thinking, new logic, and new methods, including ideological innovation, institutional innovation, management innovation, technological innovation, and product innovation. It is the reconstruction and regeneration of enterprise core competitiveness, and the most important driving force for the transformation and upgrading of food enterprises to achieve the metamorphosis from traditional enterprises to modern enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Yongjian also suggested to the participating food enterprises to pay attention to three issues: First, to upgrade from the \"product + marketing\" dual-drive model to the \"capital + technology + brand + marketing\" four-drive model, and cultivate and build new core competitiveness; second, to study and express the brand culture and sentiment appropriately; third, to scientifically choose the brand communication path and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of brand communication.\n",

      "On the morning of August 1, under the scorching sun, 28-year-old Yu Xiaoming was unusually excited. After work, he didn't even have time to eat lunch and hurried to the household registration reform office for rural-to-urban conversion at the Guanyin Bridge Subdistrict Police Station in Chongqing's Jiulongpo District, submitting his application materials for his family to become urban residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first day that Chongqing began accepting applications for rural residents to convert to urban household registration as part of its comprehensive urban-rural integration reform, which is being implemented in all 807 police stations across the city. Yu Xiaoming, from Renhe Village, Longhe Town, Changshou District, became the first rural resident to have his application officially accepted by the Guanyin Bridge Subdistrict Police Station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yu Xiaoming, who only has a junior high school education, has been working in Chongqing with his family for six years. He now works as a chef in a restaurant in the city. In 2007, he bought a 44-square-meter apartment in the Tapin area of Jiulongpo District, finally having a fixed residence in the city. However, with his child now of school age, the high sponsorship fee required for non-urban household registration has become a major challenge for Yu's family. Over the years, due to restrictions on education and housing conditions, Yu's family has been unable to convert to urban household registration. Now, with Chongqing launching the comprehensive urban-rural integration reform, many previous restrictions on rural-to-urban conversion have been lifted, and Yu's family's dream of becoming urban residents has finally come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chongqing, as a comprehensive urban-rural integration reform pilot zone, aims to ensure that rural residents, migrant workers, and their families enjoy equal rights, equal public services, and the same living conditions as urban residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of this household registration reform is a substantial step toward achieving this goal. Given that Chongqing is a major source of migrant workers and a major employment hub, this round of reform focuses on migrant workers, especially the new generation of migrant workers, as a breakthrough, while also addressing historical household registration issues such as those who have been displaced by government land acquisition but have not yet converted to non-agricultural status, as well as farmers displaced by large and medium-sized water conservancy projects who have not yet converted to non-agricultural status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guo Jinyan, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of Chongqing, said that according to the overall urban-rural planning, the converted residents will be distributed in three major areas: the main urban area, county towns, and small towns. The main urban area, as the core of the city, requires applicants to have worked or done business in the area for more than five years, purchased a complete set of commercial housing, or invested in and operated a business with a cumulative tax payment of 100,000 yuan over three years or 50,000 yuan in a single year. It is estimated that by 2020, the urban population in the main urban area will reach 10 million. If divided by population, the main urban area will then have a population equivalent to that of 10 megacities.\n",

      "**Original Title: Interlocking Steps: How the \"Four Brothers\" of Chang'e-6 Collaborate**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chang'e-6 mission recently completed a series of high-difficulty maneuvers, successfully loading lunar treasures onto the \"return express train.\" How did the various components of Chang'e-6 collaborate during these critical stages? A reporter interviewed experts from the China Academy of Space Technology (CASC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Chang'e-6 consists of four components: the orbiter, lander, ascender, and returner, collectively referred to as the \"four brothers.\" The lander is responsible for descending to the lunar surface and collecting samples, while the ascender carries the samples back to orbit and hands them over. Together, they form the lander-ascender combination. The orbiter handles the Earth-Moon transfer and sample transport, while the returner is responsible for re-entering Earth's atmosphere and delivering the samples back. These two components form the orbiter-returner combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the launch, Earth-Moon transfer, and lunar braking phases, the \"four brothers\" remain in a combined state, working together. Once in lunar orbit, the orbiter-returner combination and the lander-ascender combination separate, beginning their respective missions. After separation, the lander-ascender combination performs two orbital maneuvers to prepare for descent. Meanwhile, the orbiter-returner combination waits in lunar orbit for the ascender's arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "During descent, the lander-ascender combination decelerates at the right moment. As it nears the lunar surface, it first checks if the terrain is suitable for landing. If not, it will hover and avoid obstacles before gently descending to a safe location. After landing, it proceeds with sample collection and scientific exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the orbiter-returner combination in lunar orbit performs multiple orbital maneuvers to prepare for rendezvous, docking, and sample transfer. After successful sampling, the ascender separates from the lander and takes off vertically from the lunar surface, entering lunar orbit. The ascender and orbiter-returner combination then approach each other, completing rendezvous and docking, and transferring the samples from the ascender to the orbiter-returner combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the orbiter-returner combination heads toward the Earth-Moon entry point, beginning its return journey. After several mid-course corrections, at an altitude of about 5,000 kilometers above Earth, the orbiter and returner separate. The returner re-enters Earth's atmosphere, completing the final leg of this relay race and safely delivering the lunar soil back home. (Reporter: Song Chen)\n",

      "\n",
      "On November 18, 2014, the first \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train (Yiwu-Madrid) was launched, marking the establishment of a new starting point for the Silk Road Economic Belt. \"From the first train in the first year to 1,569 trains last year, from 82 TEUs to 129,000 TEUs, the 'Yixinou' China-Europe freight train has achieved a leap from nothing to something, from little to much, from one-way to two-way, from single line to multiple lines, and from irregular operation to regular operation,\" said Bei Xudong, deputy director of the Yiwu Market Development Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thousand years ago, the camel bells of the caravans in the desert played the prelude to East-West exchanges and supported the prosperity of the \"ancient Silk Road\"; a thousand years later, the \"steel camel trains\" rushing day and night on the rails continue the \"new Silk Road\" with passion and speed, creating a new engine for high-level opening-up in the new era.\n",

      "Integrating into the New \"Belt and Road\" Pattern\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most prominent place in the \"Yixinou\" exhibition hall at Yiwu West Station, there is a large map. The map, with Yiwu as the starting point, extends in all directions like the vines of a sweet potato, showing 19 routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The map shows the routes opened by the \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train over the years. Yiwu is embracing the world with an open and inclusive attitude. The \"New Silk Road\" runs through the Eurasian continent, connecting the countries jointly building the \"Belt and Road\" closely together.\n",
      "\n",
      "In nine years, the \"Yixinou\" has opened 19 routes, but today's prosperity was not achieved overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is difficult at the beginning. It took more than a year of effort to go from the first route to the second. \"We first need to stabilize the first route, and at the same time, we face various difficulties such as cargo assembly and customs clearance,\" said Chen Kaifeng, general manager of the business development department of the Yi Xin Ou Trade Service Group Co., Ltd. It was not until January 28, 2016, that the second route of the \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train finally departed, heading for Tehran, Iran. In the same year, Yiwu successively opened four routes to Russia, Afghanistan, Belarus, Latvia, and other countries, and the number of routes opened that year reached five, with a total of 100 trains operated.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, Yiwu, a small inland county that is not on the border or by the sea, has built the \"sixth port area\" of Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, allowing containers to enter Yiwu Port, which is equivalent to entering Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, realizing \"one declaration, one inspection, and one release.\" On this basis, Yiwu continues to innovate: operating the \"full-process bill of lading + destination port route\" new model of sea-rail intermodal transportation, realizing \"one-stop service,\" \"whole train arrival, and same ship departure\"; landing four sea-rail intermodal regular trains; landing the sea-rail intermodal direct loading mode, saving enterprises more than two days of transportation time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the construction of the Suxi International Hub Port is accelerating. After completion, it will connect the Ningbo-Jin'ui Railway and the Shanghai-Kunming Railway, directly reaching the world's largest port, Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, and accepting more sea-rail intermodal trains. More exciting is that the comprehensive supporting infrastructure project of the first phase of the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan\" Open Channel Fudian Logistics Park has been successfully topped out, and another key move has been made on the blueprint of the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan\" Open Channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yiwu is a frontier highland of opening-up and an important node of the \"Belt and Road.\" To the east, Yiwu connects with the \"Maritime Silk Road\" through sea-rail intermodal transportation and seamless docking with the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan\" Open Channel; to the west, it connects with the \"Land Silk Road\" through the \"Yixinou.\" The \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train has become a vivid practice carrier for Zhejiang Province to promote the \"Belt and Road\" initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, the \"Yixinou\" freight train Yiwu platform has operated more than 6,400 trains, with a cargo volume exceeding 520,000 TEUs. The train can reach 101 overseas stations, radiating more than 50 countries and 160 cities, greatly promoting the interconnection of \"from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea, and Yiwu directly to Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia,\" and running at a \"high speed\" in global trade exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovating Business Models\n",
      "Exploring New Growth Drivers for Freight Trains\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, two trains departed from Yiwu West Station and entered Alashankou Port. These two trains have submitted applications at the customs of the place of departure, and the procedures such as declaration, inspection, consolidation of bills of lading, and release have been completed in a \"one-stop\" manner. Upon arrival at the port, they can be released directly without customs clearance procedures. Since July 2022, the \"fast customs clearance\" logistics model for the \"Yixinou\" freight train in both directions has been implemented, reducing the customs clearance time of the train by one day and saving about 200 yuan per container.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high-quality development of \"Yixinou\" includes not only quantitative growth but also qualitative improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the first train in 2014 to more than 100 trains in 2016, and then to more than 1,000 trains in 2021, the \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train is becoming more and more frequent, and its efficiency is constantly being refreshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 14, 2022, 100 standard containers of imported paper products on the return trip of the \"Yixinou\" freight train were transported through the new \"whole train transfer\" mode, boarding the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan Port\" sea-rail intermodal train from the Yiwu West Railway Station to Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. Subsequently, the goods were transported by water to Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, and other places. Now, the \"whole train transfer\" between the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan Port\" sea-rail intermodal train and the return trip of the \"Yixinou\" freight train has become a regular practice, effectively reducing the waiting time for container assembly at the railway west station.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to \"whole train transfer,\" the Yiwu platform, through seamless connection of the two major channels of \"Yixinou\" and \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan,\" has expanded new business models such as cross-border e-commerce trains, \"Yixinou + imports,\" and \"Yixinou + transshipment.\" It transports goods from Kazakhstan, Germany, and other Eurasian countries to Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and other countries through the \"Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan\" channel. The return trip of the freight train has transformed from a single import trade model to an \"import and export, transshipment\" trade model, actively promoting the \"dual circulation\" of domestic and international markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train has also superimposed financial services, promoting the \"railway multimodal transport bill of lading property rights\" of the freight train, allowing trading enterprises to obtain \"freight loans\" or \"goods loans\" credit from banks based on the bill of lading issued by the freight train operating platform, realizing \"one-stop service\" and \"one-ticket service,\" and helping more small and medium-sized foreign trade enterprises achieve capital circulation and trade facilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the rapid growth of the freight train, the dedication of the \"Silk Road Fellow Travelers\" Party member volunteer service team is indispensable. The \"Silk Road Fellow Travelers\" Party member volunteer service team is composed of Party member volunteers from relevant units under the leadership of the Yiwu Market Development Commission, who work together and cooperate with each other to ensure the smooth operation of the freight train. The \"clean freight train\" project led by the service team integrates discipline supervision and business supervision throughout the entire process of freight train operation, promoting the improvement of freight train quality and efficiency. The service team also promptly studies the export tax rebate policy for land departure ports, promoting Yiwu to become the second city in the country to implement the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innovation of freight train business models has led to the continuous iteration of the goods transported by the freight train. In addition to Yiwu small commodities, the proportion of high-value-added products such as new energy vehicle whole vehicles and parts, and high-end mechanical equipment has significantly increased, and \"Made in China\" products are continuously going global.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recently, Fu Miaoling, general manager of Yiwu Jiehao Bamboo Products Co., Ltd., received two groups of customers from Spain and successfully completed an order. \"Look, this is the order from the Spanish customer in 2013, bamboo ornament products, worth 20,000 yuan; this is the order from the Kazakh customer in 2014, bamboo kitchen products, worth 100,000 yuan; this is the order from the Dubai customer in 2015, bamboo daily necessities, worth 200,000 yuan...\" Fu Miaoling flipped through the order book, sorted it out, and sighed, which is the record book of the changes in the export goods of the freight train. In recent years, whether it is the order amount or the product categories, it can be seen that the export of Zhejiang goods is developing better and better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train is an important trade channel for \"Zhejiang-made\" products to go to Eurasia.\n",

Nearly 70% of the cargo sources of the \"Yixinou\" China-Europe freight train come from within the province. In recent years, \"Yixinou\" has actively promoted the \"enterprise number\" and \"local number\" operation mode, creating \"high-quality freight trains,\" \"public freight trains,\" and \"characteristic freight trains,\" and opening high-quality freight trains such as Geely special train, Chunli No., and Global Yi Da No., and local special trains such as \"Zhuji No.\" to directly serve Zhejiang enterprises and businessmen, and at the same time establish new channels for the export of characteristic agricultural and sideline products in various places within the province, helping to promote the construction of a demonstration area for common prosperity.\n",

      "\n",
      "The meeting emphasized the need to quickly make full preparations for medical resources. Fever clinics should be \"established wherever possible and opened whenever possible.\" Designated hospitals and sub-designated hospitals should increase the proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, increase the production and reserves of treatment drugs, and effectively enhance medical treatment capacity. It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the tiered diagnosis and treatment service system, strengthen the equipment provision and upgrading of grassroots medical and health institutions, coordinate conventional medical services, strictly implement various measures to prevent hospital-acquired infections, maintain normal medical order, and truly meet the medical needs of the public. It is necessary to solidly build defense lines, focus on eight types of special places such as nursing homes and welfare institutions to strengthen the implementation of prevention and control measures, strengthen prevention and control in key institutional places such as childcare facilities and primary and secondary schools, and effectively reduce the risk of epidemic transmission. It is necessary to closely monitor key populations, focus on the elderly and children to strengthen health guidance and services, and improve the epidemic prevention capabilities of \"the elderly and the young.\" It is necessary to accelerate the promotion of vaccination among the elderly, urge all localities to implement their territorial responsibilities, further strengthen organization and mobilization, optimize vaccination services, and effectively build an immune barrier. It is necessary to strengthen service guarantees, accurately and efficiently provide materials, daily life, and medical services for residents in high-risk areas, home quarantined individuals, and home treatment individuals. It is necessary to strengthen policy promotion and popular science education on epidemic prevention knowledge, guide the public to be the primary responsible person for their own health, pay attention to personal protection, insist on wearing masks, frequent handwashing, and reducing gatherings, thereby building social consensus and strong synergy to jointly fight the epidemic. It is necessary to strengthen the implementation of responsibilities. Leading comrades of party and government in all localities and departments must personally take charge and personally supervise, always maintain the efficient operation of the emergency command system, meticulously carry out all tasks, and ensure that epidemic prevention and control and medical service work are carried out effectively and orderly.\n",

The relevant research findings were recently published in Science Advances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathological features such as hyperglycemia, bacterial infection, and chronic inflammation are the main reasons why wounds in diabetic patients are difficult to heal. In addition, like other wounds, wounds in diabetic patients are often accompanied by scar formation after healing, which is also one of the unsolved clinical problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "This study, addressing the pathological characteristics of diabetic wounds, fully utilizes the technical advantages of microneedle patches, such as minimal invasiveness, painlessness, and self-fixation, combined with the characteristics of biofuel cells, which can use sugar as fuel, have good biocompatibility, and generate stable and long-lasting current, innovatively designed and fabricated a self-powered enzyme-linked MN patch. The patch consists of anode and cathode MN arrays, which respectively contain glucose oxidase (GOX) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encapsulated by ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Through the enzymatic cascade reaction in this MN patch, it can effectively reduce local hyperglycemia in diabetic wounds, and simultaneously generate a stable microcurrent to promote rapid healing of diabetic wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research results show that after treating diabetic wounds (wound area 1 square centimeter) with this MN patch, rapid and complete healing of diabetic wounds can be achieved within 3 weeks, and scar formation can be effectively prevented. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of glucose reduction, antibacterial properties, anti-inflammation, and bioelectrical stimulation of the MN patch. Therefore, this study proposes an effective method to promote rapid healing and prevent scar formation in diabetic wounds, which is expected to change the current difficult-to-heal status of wounds in diabetic patients.\n",

      "After falling for 9 consecutive months, recent pork prices have rebounded. However, the market generally expects that pork prices will remain low in the short term. Relevant parties should continue to strengthen macro-control, rationally guide expectations, prevent large fluctuations in pork prices, avoid blindly chasing \"hot trends,\" and prevent \"high meat prices harming the people and low meat prices harming farmers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the continuous decline in pork prices has pleased consumers, persistently falling pork prices will also dampen the enthusiasm of pig farmers, affecting future pork supply and price stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the beginning of this year, persistently \"bottoming out\" pork prices have put pressure on pig farmers. According to fixed-point monitoring by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the proportion of pig farmers operating at a loss reached 62% in June, an increase of 52 percentage points from May. Although current pork prices have rebounded, due to the pork market still tending towards a relaxed supply-demand situation, there is limited room for price increases in the short term. The continuous downward market expectations for pork, coupled with the ongoing uncertainty of African Swine Fever, have led many farmers to scale back their operations, even slaughtering sows, and planning to exit the pig farming industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, it is necessary to both guide pig farmers to reasonably adjust their production structure and accelerate the transformation and upgrading of the pig industry, promoting high-quality development of the pig industry. In particular, the government's role in pork reserves should be fully utilized to regulate prices, emphasizing both \"raising\" and \"lowering\" prices for live pigs and pork, ensuring price stability through stable supply, and promoting supply stability through price stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trend of pork prices directly affects the trend of food prices. To stabilize pork prices, both short-term and long-term goals must be considered, leveraging the roles of an effective market and a capable government, focusing on smoothing out the \"pig cycle\" of large price fluctuations, and fundamentally establishing the \"four pillars and eight supports\" for price regulation of important livelihood commodities such as pork.

      "“Gesang Flower of the Seismological Station”\n",
      "■Luo Song Yang Yao\n",
      "In Sichuan Province, there is a high-plateau canyon city famous for its love songs – Kangding. However, the Kangding Seismological Station of the Sichuan Earthquake Administration, located in the northern suburbs of Kangding city, is little known. Luorong Kangzhu, a Tibetan girl, has been working here for 12 years, engaged in macroscopic observation of underground fluids (hot springs) and crustal deformation, and she has long considered this place her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, Kangzhu, who had already worked for 10 years in the Ganzi Prefecture Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe, received an opportunity for a job transfer. She proactively applied to be transferred to the Kangding Seismological Station. “My father was the first generation of seismologists at Sichuan earthquake stations. When I was little, I often followed him to collect water samples. He treated observation data as more important than himself, 365 days a year, rain or shine, never stopping. Under his influence, I developed a yearning and aspiration for the earthquake cause from a young age, secretly vowing to also engage in earthquake observation work in the future,” Luorong Kangzhu said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving at the seismological station, besides feeling unaccustomed, Luorong Kangzhu's main problem was not knowing where to start. Her colleagues at the station told Luorong Kangzhu: “It’s okay if you don’t know, you’re young, you’ll learn fast!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Preprocessing sample data, instrument calibration, instrument maintenance, abnormal verification report writing… Encouraged by her colleagues, Luorong Kangzhu started from scratch, exerting all her effort to learn. She practiced changing the recording photographic paper for the deformation observation instrument installed inside the cave; since it couldn’t be exposed to light, she had to operate in the dark within the 25-meter-deep cave. “First, I practiced simulated operations with my eyes closed in the office for a month, then I studied with colleagues for another month, and finally, I could change the photographic paper independently.” Although the station underwent digital transformation several years ago, Luorong Kangzhu still vividly remembers this experience. As winter turned to spring, the diligent and studious Luorong Kangzhu quickly became the station’s “Observation Expert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In early March, Kangding was still experiencing the lingering chill after a brief warm spell. Just after 7 AM, at the end of a country road, walking about 600 meters up a steep slope, Luorong Kangzhu arrived in front of a small house halfway up the mountain. She gently pushed open the iron gate, and in the small space of the Longtougou hot spring observation point, skillfully measured the water temperature, extracted spring water samples with prepared test tubes, and collected air samples with a gas collecting bottle. She carefully packed the samples, checked that the surrounding environment was normal, then returned the same way to the roadside, walked 2 kilometers to the nearest bus stop, and took a bus back to the station for further processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Collecting water samples has strict requirements for water flow speed; it can be neither too fast nor too slow, and the air bubbles contained in the water sample must also meet requirements. I practiced this technique for over a year, and finally, I mastered the essentials,” Luorong Kangzhu said proudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in Kangding. During this period, Luorong Kangzhu proactively undertook the task of hot spring observation and sampling, walking 11 kilometers daily for over 10 consecutive days to the Longtougou hot spring observation point to retrieve water samples, providing scientific data for the command center to carry out earthquake prediction work. She was dubbed the “Gesang Flower of the Seismological Station.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To minimize interference, earthquake hot spring monitoring points are generally chosen in areas with high mountains and steep roads, far from human habitation. This makes data collection and equipment maintenance particularly difficult. Luorong Kangzhu did not flinch; no matter how cold, windy, or snowy it was in the plateau winter, she would arrive on time to collect samples, ensuring the timeliness, continuity, and reliability of the first-hand monitoring data.\n",
      "\n",
      "After completing the day's data processing, Luorong Kangzhu began her daily patrol work, inspecting and recording the observation site, instruments and equipment, and surrounding environment 6 times. After completing the last patrol of the day, it was already late at night. Sleepless, Luorong Kangzhu strolled to the Yala River. Looking at the tranquil Kangding city across the river, Luorong Kangzhu recalled her father's words: \"In fact, what we do is to make our utmost efforts to ensure the continuity of observation, because only this can guarantee the original reliability of the data, and thus protect people's lives and safety.\" On her way back, Luorong Kangzhu saw the Gesang flowers by the roadside had quietly bloomed, swaying gracefully in the lamplight, beautiful and captivating.\n",

      "“After living here for 10 years, finally getting the ‘big red book’ today, now I feel at ease!” stroking her property deed, 71-year-old Aunt Guo, a resident of Xiaowayao Village, was reluctant to put it back in her bag for a long time. Yesterday morning, four residents of Zhaofeng Xinyuan residential community in Fengtai District obtained their property deeds, and the stone that had weighed on everyone's hearts for years finally landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why was the property deed delayed for 10 years? In 2014, Zhaofeng Xinyuan community was completed and residents moved in successively. As a relocation housing project for farmers in the green isolation area of Xiaowayao Village, the community has a total of 9 residential buildings, providing 1987 units. However, because the project was designed and built relatively early, it could not meet the requirements for planning and completion approval procedures, leading to slow progress in obtaining property deeds, which became a long-standing concern for many relocated villagers in Xiaowayao Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, when Aunt Guo's children needed to register their household, attend school, obtain property certificates, or even claim heating subsidies from their workplace annually, she, already in her sixties, had to run back and forth repeatedly to get certifications. “Without the property deed, I had to rely on the demolition agreement, photocopying this, printing that. I’m old now and it’s too much for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Real estate registration is the final step in a construction project; any issues in a preceding step will manifest during the certificate application process. “When residents report to the registration department, we adhere to the principle of 'whoever approves is responsible,' and whichever department is responsible for the bottleneck or sticking point must propose solutions and measures. We then collaborate with relevant functional departments to jointly study ways to resolve historical outstanding issues,” said a relevant official from the Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “12345 hotlines,” which are effective upon a single call, have also become a platform for big data on public well-being. Where are the pain points, blockages, and urgent difficulties in residents' demands for certificates? The work order data speaks for itself. Reducing issues at the source, proactive governance, classified research, analyzing causes… projects are accurately categorized as “can be processed,” “pending,” and “cannot be processed,” and resolved according to their category, providing positive responses to the concerns of the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire safety issues were the biggest bottleneck for the \"difficulty in obtaining certificates\" at Zhaofeng Xinyuan community previously. Through the unremitting efforts of multiple departments, a turning point emerged in June 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the principle of \"respecting history, prioritizing no-fault,\" the Fengtai Branch of the Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Commission issued a planning verification opinion and a land allocation decision for the project, on the premise that the development entity strictly fulfilled its fire safety responsibilities. This successfully resolved issues such as missing planning and land supply procedures for the project. Simultaneously, relying on the special task force for addressing historical outstanding issues of unissued certificates in Fengtai District, and in collaboration with the Fengtai District Housing Management Bureau, Fengtai District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Commission, Fengtai Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the local Lugouqiao Street, the procedures for project completion, building numbers, surveying and mapping, and stamp duty exemption were completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A green channel has also been set up at the Fengtai District Real Estate Registration Center, specifically for handling applications for historical outstanding projects. Xu Zhe, Deputy Director of the Fengtai District Real Estate Registration Center, stated that Xiaowayao Village is currently pushing forward the prerequisite procedures for transfer registration in an orderly manner, with nearly a hundred households having successfully completed the transfer registration. Residents are expected to obtain their individual property deeds in batches this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in 2019, the Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Commission took the lead in initiating work to resolve real estate registration issues for historical outstanding projects, making this \"people's livelihood practical matter\" an important task. With public satisfaction as the benchmark, overall planning was carried out, and relevant departments formed a synergy: a \"ledger of historical outstanding projects\" was established for fine-grained classification management; two deliberation platforms were set up, with a reasonable division of labor according to \"municipal-level policy-making, district-level primary responsibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, despite the complexity and difficulty of resolving issues in the remaining projects, the municipal and district levels focused on tackling the challenges. Through efforts, paths for obtaining certificates were opened for 82,000 homes across 73 projects, achieving significant results. As of the end of last year, paths for obtaining certificates had been opened for approximately 496,000 homes across 616 projects citywide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s almost Chinese New Year, this is truly double happiness, the best New Year’s gift I’ve received!” Leaving the Real Estate Registration Center, Aunt Guo was still overjoyed, her face beaming with smiles. Having the property deed in hand will bring tangible changes to her life. “My children are grown up and should start their own families; now there are no more worries.” By our reporter Yuan Lu.\n",

      "“Okinawa Prefecture hopes to fully leverage our unique history and traditional culture, as well as soft power and advantages such as the natural environment, to promote Japan-China exchanges based on friendly relations and contribute to the development of bilateral relations.” Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki said this in a recent exclusive interview with the Global Times. He plans to visit China in early July, during which he will visit Fujian and other places. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Japanese government has accelerated the hyping of the so-called “Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency,” but Denny Tamaki firmly stated that he would never allow Okinawa to become a battlefield due to this argument. Denny Tamaki visited the United States in March. He believes that military conflict would harm the national interests of both China and the United States, and that Japan and the United States should make due efforts to de-escalate the situation.\n",

      "**Global Times:** You have visited China twice before. What are your expectations for this third visit to China?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Denny Tamaki:** I am very much looking forward to visiting China again after a four-year hiatus. I hope to take this visit as an opportunity to revisit the long history of exchanges between Okinawa and China and to create opportunities for deeper future exchanges. To this end, if time permits, after visiting Beijing with the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade delegation, I will also visit Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, which has deep historical ties with Okinawa Prefecture, to further deepen exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although exchanges between China and Okinawa have gradually resumed after the pandemic, before traveling from Okinawa to China, it is still necessary to apply for a visa at the Chinese Consulate-General in Fukuoka (located in Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu region of Japan, far from Okinawa – Editor’s Note), which implicitly increases the burden of traveling to China. To further develop various exchanges, including tourism, we hope for an appropriate relaxation of visa policies for Okinawan tourists traveling to China, and we also look forward to the early resumption of direct flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the perspective of deepening exchanges, I may also propose some ideas on cultural, academic, and exchanges between the younger generations of Japan and China.

      "**Global Times:** We know that you have exchanged views with Chinese Consul General in Fukuoka, Lyu Guijun. Okinawa Prefecture Vice Governor Yoshimi Teruya also held talks with Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao. In your opinion, what role do interactions between Okinawa and China play in promoting regional peace and stability?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Denny Tamaki:** The history of friendly exchanges between Okinawa and China can be traced back more than 600 years. In 1997, Okinawa Prefecture and Fujian Province established friendly prefecture-province relations, taking their friendship to a new level. Okinawa and China send and receive students from each other, promoting exchanges among the new generation of young people. Furthermore, to promote economic exchanges, Okinawa Prefecture has opened overseas offices in China to help export local products and assist local companies in expanding overseas. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were six direct flights between China and Okinawa, and many Chinese tourists also visited Okinawa by cruise ship. These are unique exchange activities characteristic of Okinawa, and we will adhere to and develop them, as they are very important for regional peace and stability.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Global Times:** While the Japanese government is strengthening its military \"defense\" capabilities, the people of Okinawa continue to express their desire for peace. In April, a delegation of Okinawa Prefectural Assembly members submitted a peace diplomacy resolution, adopted by the prefectural assembly, to the Ministry of Defense and other departments, calling for peaceful resolution of issues through dialogue and diplomacy. Does this indicate a divergence between Okinawa and the Japanese government on diplomacy and security?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Denny Tamaki:** The Japanese government adopted the so-called new version of the three security documents in December last year, stating that in response to the “severe” security environment, Japan must strengthen its defense capabilities and enhance the Self-Defense Forces’ presence in the Southwest Islands. Okinawa Prefecture understands the “necessity of maintaining a minimum level of self-defense capabilities” to maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Alliance and the principle of “exclusive defense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, even today, 78 years after the end of World War II, approximately 70% of U.S. military bases in Japan are still concentrated in Okinawa, and the people of Okinawa have consistently demanded that the Japanese central government substantially reduce U.S. military bases in the prefecture through concrete actions. From Okinawa Prefecture’s perspective, we believe that attempting to strengthen deterrence by enhancing military capabilities will escalate regional tensions and may lead to unpredictable situations, which is very concerning. Okinawa must not become an easy target for attack simply because U.S. military bases are concentrated here. We will, as always, do our utmost to urge the Japanese government to ensure that this does not happen, and actively seek for all parties to de-escalate tensions and build trust through peaceful diplomacy and dialogue.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Denny Tamaki:** From March 6 to 11 this year, I visited Washington D.C., where I held meetings with local government officials, congressional members, experts, and scholars. During these meetings, I not only directly expressed my views on the current situation in Okinawa, but also, due to Okinawa’s close proximity to Taiwan, I elaborated on the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. I believe that the economic interdependence between China and the United States is deepening, and military conflict would mean the destruction of this mutually beneficial relationship and would also harm the national interests of both countries. Furthermore, the Japanese and U.S. governments should de-escalate tensions and build trust through peaceful diplomacy and dialogue, making due efforts to prevent unexpected incidents.\n",

However, there are also questioning voices from mainland Japan, such as “Okinawa Prefecture has a mountain of political issues and should not get involved in international exchanges.” What is your view on this phenomenon?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Denny Tamaki:** The term “diplomacy” generally gives the impression of “inter-state diplomacy” conducted by states as primary actors. However, the “regional diplomacy” proposed by Okinawa Prefecture refers to activities carried out across national borders by various entities such as local governments (similar to local governments and administrative bodies – Editor’s Note), businesses, and non-governmental organizations in multiple fields such as international exchange and technical cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also views local governments and organizations as important partners in promoting diplomacy and supports their internationalization efforts. In August 2006, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established the Office for Regional Cooperation Promotion, aiming to promote economic cooperation with regions and thereby strengthen Japan’s overall diplomatic capabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okinawa Prefecture was historically embroiled in brutal warfare. At that time, one in four Okinawans perished. After the war, as the Japanese central government pursued a “military-first” policy, the basic rights of the prefectural residents were also infringed upon. Therefore, all Okinawans have an ardent wish – that Okinawa must never become a battlefield again. Based on the lessons of this history, Okinawa Prefecture actively promotes inter-regional exchanges and disseminates the “Spirit of Okinawa,” which pursues peace, to the world.\n",

To build a self-reliant economy, we will develop Okinawa into a world-class sustainable tourism destination, support the construction of a digital society, develop and add value to information and communication-related industries, and rely on Asian vitality to establish an international logistics hub in Okinawa, among other things.\n",

      "In the third quarter of 2022, the national per capita disposable income of residents was 27,600 yuan, while Henan residents' per capita disposable income was 20,200 yuan, ranking 23rd nationally, with a significant gap compared to the top three provinces/cities such as Shanghai (59,500 yuan), Beijing (58,600 yuan), and Zhejiang (47,000 yuan). Income is the premise and foundation of consumption; only by fully guaranteeing residents' income can consumption capacity and willingness be effectively enhanced. We must continuously stabilize employment, improve social security, optimize the income distribution structure, expand the middle-income group, and thus solidly promote and achieve common prosperity. First, increase the proportion of labor remuneration in primary distribution. Labor remuneration is the main source of residents' income; increasing its proportion in primary distribution helps stimulate work enthusiasm and promote more fair and reasonable income distribution. Second, improve the redistribution regulation mechanism. In the third quarter of 2022, the urban-rural income ratio in Henan was 2.23, indicating a significant income gap between urban and rural areas. It is necessary to narrow the income gap and promote common prosperity by well regulating redistribution, such as increasing the intensity and precision of regulation on taxation, social security, transfer payments, and charity. Third, increase the income of low-income groups. Low-income groups still account for a certain proportion in Henan. Improving employment quality and increasing the income of low-income groups can effectively stimulate the vitality of the basic consumer market and drive the growth of basic consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Enrich Consumer Supply, Promote Consumption Upgrades**\n",
      "Whether consumer demand can ultimately be met also depends on the supply situation. We must firmly grasp the main line of supply-side structural reform, promote consumption upgrades, vigorously optimize market supply, and unblock the domestic circulation through a high-level matching of supply and demand. First, improve commercial and trade circulation infrastructure and establish a sound urban and rural modern commercial and trade circulation system. As an important part of the modern circulation system, the modern commercial and trade circulation system is not only the most active basic industrial system for investment demand but also the main channel for meeting residents' consumption needs. Second, cultivate a number of representative new consumption demonstration cities and create regional consumption growth poles. Vigorously support Zhengzhou and Luoyang in building international consumption center cities. At the same time, accelerate the high-quality transformation and upgrading of urban blocks and residential areas, and cultivate iconic business districts; focusing on residents' daily needs, create 15-minute convenience service living circles. Third, encourage the development of new consumption models, new hotspots, and new business forms to meet the people's growing needs for a better life. Seize the opportunity of accelerated cultural-tourism integration to cultivate multi-subject, multi-faceted, and diversified consumption scenarios, create night consumption clusters based on local conditions, and build night consumption brands such as \"Zhengzhou Night Commercial Capital,\" \"Luoyang Ancient Capital Night 8 PM,\" and \"Kaifeng Song Imperial City Food Capital,\" develop the night economy, and expand consumption space.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Optimize Consumption Environment, Improve Consumption Quality**\n",
      "A complete consumption system can effectively regulate consumer behavior, safeguard consumers' legitimate consumption demands, eliminate consumption concerns, and enhance consumer confidence. With adequate consumption environment guarantees, people will dare to \"buy with peace of mind.\" Currently, Henan's resident consumption sector faces a series of problems such as lagging service industry standard systems, imperfect post-consumption evaluation systems, and lagging integrity and rights protection system construction. Some infringements on consumer rights have not been handled or have been handled ineffectively, leading to a lack of good environmental guarantees for resident consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen market order supervision, severely crack down on infringing acts and illegal and criminal activities such as manufacturing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods, strengthen the construction of credit systems for enterprises and relevant personnel, improve personal information protection systems, unblock consumer rights protection channels, and form a multi-party co-construction, co-governance, and shared consumption ecosystem involving government supervision, industry self-regulation, and social supervision. At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate rational consumption concepts and create a positive consumption atmosphere. Scientific and rational consumption concepts can effectively regulate consumption behavior and improve consumption quality. It is necessary to cultivate lifestyles and consumption models that are thrifty, moderate, green, low-carbon, civilized, and healthy, use new media and other promotional methods to guide consumption and popularize knowledge, and comprehensively create a positive consumption cultural atmosphere from the perspectives of the consumer market, consumption environment, consumption ethics, consumption customs, and corporate integrity management, ultimately enabling the vast number of consumers to \"be able to consume, dare to consume, and be good at consuming.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "China Travel Service (CTS) Group highly values the spirit of this notice and its implementation. A joint meeting of the Board of Directors and General Managers was specially convened to implement the spirit of the notice. In light of the actual situation where some industries within CTS Group have experienced significant year-on-year declines in profitability since the beginning of this year due to the macroeconomic situation and a downturn in industry prosperity, and to ensure the smooth completion of the annual operation and production tasks, the Group proposed ten specific work objectives, measures, and opinions in accordance with the notice's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, strictly implement responsibilities for stabilizing growth and enhancing profitability. The main leaders of CTS Group personally took charge, studying and implementing measures for broadening income sources, reducing expenditures, cutting costs, and increasing efficiency. They proposed four key work areas: \"focus on operations to generate profits, control costs and expenses to achieve efficiency, monetize existing assets to find profits, and manage finances well to add to profits.\" It is required to decompose and implement these key areas level by level and enterprise by enterprise, formulate specific methods and targets, and ensure that measures are put into practice. At the same time, the spirit of the notice will be linked with management improvement efforts, with stabilizing growth and enhancing profitability being promoted as important measures for management improvement, and assessment and incentive measures will be continuously refined to encourage increased revenue and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, genuinely strengthen economic operation monitoring and analysis. Facing the complex external economic situation, CTS Group requires all enterprises to closely track and carefully study the current complex and severe economic situation, earnestly strengthen economic situation analysis, consistently maintain a clear mind, accurately identify various risks, and ensure that the analysis of the situation and corresponding measures are implemented in all work tasks for 2013. Simultaneously, research on new industries such as the elderly care industry and cruise tourism will be strengthened to capture new development opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, intensify efforts in market development and revenue/efficiency increase. The seven major business segments under CTS Group will further intensify efforts in market development and revenue/efficiency increase, and have successively proposed specific measures: The main tourism business will seize market opportunities, expand markets, innovate products, and increase efforts in revenue and efficiency generation, while clarifying specific targets and key measures for enterprise revenue and efficiency; The steel segment will fully tap potential, control inventory, and promote technological innovation; The real estate segment will actively promote the sale of existing properties and asset disposal; The logistics segment will focus on improving the profitability of new outlets and actively extending the industrial chain to form synergy; The asset management segment will increase the disposal of existing assets; The power generation segment will focus on broadening income sources and reducing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, genuinely strengthen collaboration among central enterprises. Efforts to integrate resources and engage in strategic cooperation with other central enterprises will continue to be strengthened. Specific areas include travel agencies, steel, hotels, scenic areas, RVs, logistics services, business travel and MICE services, among others. Cooperation partners include industry-leading central enterprises such as Sinopec, Huaneng, Shenhua, and Baosteel. For example, strategic cooperation will be carried out with COFCO Group in multiple aspects such as food and gift procurement, customer resource sharing, and tourism services; comprehensive, multi-level, and multi-dimensional cooperation with Ping An Group will cover banking, investment, insurance, tourism, MICE, business travel services, real estate, and scenic areas; and comprehensive cooperation with NORINCO Group will cover tourism RVs and hot spring resorts, among others.\n",

The principle of prudent investment will be adhered to, controlling investment scale and pace, especially fully considering market risks and self-imposed pressures, compressing investments in non-tourism businesses, and further reducing market risks and capital occupation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, increase the revitalization of assets.

The builders of Shaling watered abundant fruits with their wisdom and sweat, continuing to write the legend of China National Gold Group's super-deep vertical shaft construction, and welcoming the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China with outstanding achievements. Looking back at the construction process of the main shaft project at Shaling, as a supporting demonstration project for the \"Deep Earth Resource Exploration and Exploitation\" scientific research program under the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" key research and development plan, the main shaft project penetrated the Jiaojia main fault plane. Complex geological conditions, high temperatures, high lifting requirements, high ground stress, high osmotic pressure, large water inflow, and strong corrosion issues followed one after another, almost covering all types of difficulties faced by super-deep vertical shafts in China, making construction extremely difficult. Faced with rarely seen unfavorable construction conditions in China, all participating employees fully carried forward the work style of \"acting immediately and working diligently.\" Since construction began in May 2019, they have moved forward bravely without waiting or relying on others, establishing a \"Joint Party Group\" to focus on tackling construction difficulties. Pooling their wisdom, they successively overcame eight major construction challenges, including deep vertical shaft construction efficiency, blasting efficiency optimization, grouting for water control, and equipment operation; invited experts from top domestic research institutions to diagnose on-site, continuously discussed solutions, and formed a series of deep construction operation norms, represented by post-wall grouting under complex deep geological conditions, successfully filling numerous technical gaps in the field of super-deep vertical shaft construction in China; continuously consolidated \"Three Basics\" construction, effectively leveraged the safety management advantage of \"everyone is a safety officer,\" adhered to the principle of accountability and due diligence for safety production, and polished the \"safety foundation\" for high-quality project development.

Over the past year, the international environment has been turbulent and treacherous, and the tasks of domestic reform, development, and stability have been arduous and heavy. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core united and led the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to face difficulties head-on, comprehensively implement the requirements of ensuring epidemic prevention, economic stability, and safe development, coordinate the domestic and international two major situations, coordinate epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, coordinate development and security, intensify macro-control efforts, achieve steady improvement in development quality, fruitful results in scientific and technological innovation, and comprehensive deepening of reform and opening up, maintaining overall economic and social stability. The economy maintained growth throughout the year, employment was generally stable, prices were stable, and the balance of international payments was good. Grain output remained above 1.3 trillion jin for 8 consecutive years, and food security, energy security, and people's livelihoods were effectively guaranteed. The Beijing Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics were successfully held. In the complex situation where the once-in-a-century changes and the century's epidemic overlapped, facing the impact of unexpected factors and numerous difficulties and challenges, our ability to achieve such results is truly difficult and deserves to be cherished!\n",

Looking back at the past decade since the new era, there have been risks of wading through shallows, difficulties of climbing slopes, and challenges of breaking through barriers. It has been an extremely unusual and extraordinary period in the development process of the Party and the country. The heavy and arduous nature of the tasks we have undertaken is rarely seen in the world and in history. Stabilizing the economy, promoting development, combating poverty, building a moderately prosperous society, controlling epidemics, combating major disasters, responding to changes, resolving crises... Over the past decade, we have overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties and obstacles, created one after another astonishing human miracles, withstood risks and challenges from political, economic, ideological, and natural aspects, and achieved great success in socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n",

Practice has fully proven that the \"Two Establishes\" (establishment of Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and establishment of the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era) are the decisive factors for the Party and the country to achieve historical achievements and undergo historical changes, and are the greatest certainty, greatest confidence, and greatest guarantee for overcoming all difficulties and challenges and responding to all uncertainties. Today, a thriving China, a confident and self-reliant nation, stands majestically in the East of the world, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process.

On the path ahead, the more turbulent and challenging the weather, the more uphill the climb, the more we must strengthen strategic confidence and maintain strategic resolve. We must firmly resolve to not change our aspirations or our path, fully recognize and make good use of China's strategically favorable conditions for development, concentrate on managing our own affairs well, firmly hold the destiny of China's development and progress in our own hands, advance steadily and seek progress while maintaining stability, and the giant ship of China will surely cut through waves and sail far and wide steadily.\n",

The realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is at a critical juncture. Every step forward is an arduous climb, bearing heavy responsibilities; every step is a breakthrough against difficulties. We must never become arrogant because of victory, never slacken because of achievements, and never shrink back because of difficulties. Regardless of how the situation changes, regardless of how severe the challenges, by grasping the laws and trends of historical development, inspiring the power of progress with the power of thought, grasping historical initiative through theoretical initiative, constantly honing our spirit and capability of struggle, forging ahead in the face of difficulties, and striving with vigor, we will certainly be able to open up new horizons for the development of our cause through tenacious struggle.\n",

United struggle is the only path for the Chinese people to create historical achievements. At this point, with the boat in midstream and people halfway up the mountain, what is needed is for the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to unite as \"a hard piece of steel\" under the Party's banner, thinking with one mind and exerting strength in one direction, coalescing wisdom and strength, and unleashing creative vitality and development momentum. By continuously consolidating the great unity of all ethnic groups across the country, strengthening the great unity of Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad, gathering the powerful strength of millions of people united as one, daring to take on responsibilities, acting proactively, seeking truth and being pragmatic, and working diligently, we will certainly be able to realize the Chinese Dream with one heart.\n",

The order required the steel plates to be delivered in TMCP condition, ensuring -20℃ low-temperature impact performance, with a maximum thickness of 150mm. In the industry, it is generally believed that the thickness limit for producing steel plates using the TMCP process is 100mm; a thickness of 150mm far exceeds the industry's understanding of the TMCP process's production capacity. Such production requirements for \"great thickness, high strength, and high toughness\" have always been regarded as a \"technical forbidden zone\" in the industry, demonstrating the high difficulty of its production technology and presenting a brand new challenge to Yingkou Medium Plate's existing equipment capabilities and product development technical capabilities.\n",

During the production process, engineers from the Product Development Department and the Thick Plate Plant went deep into the site, tracking the rolling process piece by piece and guiding process optimization. With strict implementation of the technical plan by all departments, the development of the 150mm extra-thick S460M-Z35 steel plates was finally successfully completed. This batch of steel plates achieved a 100% first-pass yield, successfully passed third-party inspection, and exhibited excellent physical performance, with an average yield strength of 451MPa, average tensile strength of 578MPa, average impact energy at -20℃ of 254J, and average Z-direction performance of 52%.

The Nanjing Yuhuatai Martyrs Memorial Park Administration, with \"Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the Party\" as its theme, selected some red sculpture works from relevant cultural and museum institutions nationwide and launched the \"Condensed History, Eternal Original Aspiration - Red Sculpture Exhibition Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China\" at the summit. This exhibition at the summit utilized all-media formats such as sculpture manuscripts, models, reproductions, VR, holographic projection, audio/video, and images/text to tell the Party history stories embodied in the sculptures. This current exhibition once again carefully selected some sculpture works from that collection to be displayed in the form of a photo exhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exhibition is divided into four sections: \"Milestones of Original Aspiration,\" \"Revolutionary Memories,\" \"Ode to Heroes,\" and \"Spirit of Cohesion.\" The exhibition takes the spiritual lineage of Chinese Communists as its main thread and revolutionary memorial museums visited by General Secretary Xi Jinping as its clues, highlighting major events and important figures in the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the people in revolution, construction, and rejuvenation. The exhibition also includes images of sculpture works reflecting the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "\n",
      "The communiqué states that building upon its predecessor, Evo 1, Evo 2 has evolved into the largest AI model in the field of biology to date. The model was trained on 9.3 trillion nucleotides from over 128,000 genomic data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The developers stated that the development of Evo 1 and Evo 2 models represents a critical moment in the emerging field of generative biology, as these models enable machines to \"read, write, and think in the language of nucleotides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the introduction, Evo 2 can be used for various tasks, capable of identifying genetic changes that affect protein function and organism adaptability. For example, in tests targeting variants of the BRCA1 gene associated with breast cancer, Evo 2 achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting which mutations are benign and which are potentially pathogenic. This will help save a significant amount of time and research funding typically used for cell or animal experiments, accelerating new drug development by identifying the genetic causes of human diseases. Furthermore, Evo 2 can also be used to design new biological tools or therapeutic methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communiqué also emphasized that, considering potential ethical and safety risks, researchers excluded pathogens that infect humans and other complex organisms from Evo 2's foundational dataset and ensured that the model would not return valid answers to queries related to these pathogens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Evo 2 is open to researchers worldwide, who can use the model via a webpage or freely download its source code, training data, and parameters. A preprint paper on the related research was published on the \"BioRxiv\" preprint server on February 19.\n",

      "The General Office of the State Council recently issued the \"Opinions on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Schemes\". Workers who participate in the urban employee basic old-age insurance or the urban and rural resident basic old-age insurance within China can join the individual pension scheme. What is the significance of the individual pension scheme, which concerns 1 billion people? What benefits will participants gain? How can one achieve preservation and appreciation of value through investment? At the State Council's regular policy briefing held on the 25th, relevant officials from four departments, including the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, provided detailed interpretations of the market's hot topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The introduction of the individual pension scheme holds landmark significance for the construction of our country's multi-level, multi-pillar old-age insurance system,\" said Li Zhong, Vice Minister of Human Resources and Social Security. He stated that the implementation of the system is conducive to adding another accumulation on top of the basic old-age insurance, enterprise annuities, and occupational annuities, enabling an additional income after retirement and further improving the quality of life in retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nie Mingjun, Director of the Pension Insurance Department of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, stated that the most direct benefit of participating in the individual pension scheme is being able to enjoy national tax preferential policies. In addition, it can enrich diversified old-age needs and help individuals rationally plan their old-age funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The individual pension scheme is an entirely new system, and its implementation involves many departments and links. In the process of formulating policies, particular attention was paid to the simplicity and effectiveness of operations,\" Li Zhong said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nie Mingjun further pointed out that, firstly, the participation conditions are relatively simple: in-service personnel can participate fairly in the system as long as they are willing; currently, the number of people participating in basic old-age insurance is 1.03 billion. Secondly, the participation method is relatively flexible: participants can independently decide how much to contribute, either in a lump sum or in installments within the current year. Thirdly, account opening is relatively simple. Fourthly, investment is relatively convenient: participants can independently choose from bank wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial old-age insurance, public funds, and so on. Fifthly, the withdrawal method is relatively flexible: when participants meet the withdrawal conditions, they can choose to receive payments monthly, in installments, or in a lump sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin Xiaozheng, head of the Securities and Fund Institutions Supervision Department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, stated that in the next step, they will promptly introduce relevant institutional rules for individual pension investment in public funds, improve industry infrastructure platforms, continuously strengthen the supervision of institutions and practitioners, focus on promoting the enhancement of fund managers' investment management capabilities and standardized operation levels, strengthen investor protection, and effectively ensure the safe and standardized operation of pension investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Honghe, head of the Personal Insurance Supervision Department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, stated that the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission will prudently and orderly promote banking and insurance institutions to conduct individual pension-related financial businesses in a standardized manner, ensure the stable operation of individual pension fund accounts, and implement national tax preferential policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that currently, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission is researching and formulating relevant supporting policies to clarify fund account rules and related product management requirements, ensuring the launch of more banking and insurance products that are safe to operate, mature and stable, standard in underlying assets, and focused on long-term value preservation. Relevant documents will be open for public comment at an appropriate time and based on the overall arrangements for the implementation of the individual pension scheme.\n",

As a \"World City of Literature\" designated by UNESCO, Nanjing's literary atmosphere is growing richer thanks to the continuous efforts of a host of writers, bookstores, literary critics, as well as the government and the publishing and cultural industries. Hangzhou, about an hour and a half away from Nanjing by high-speed train, also spares no effort in promoting reading. It is often said, \"Above there is paradise, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.\" Hangzhou boasts famous must-visit attractions like West Lake and Xixi, and also numerous art and cultural spaces hidden within everyday scenes like lakeside areas, under willows, and in alleys, which are equally captivating.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this trip to Hangzhou, we stayed near Xixi Wetland. On the day of our arrival, we couldn't resist visiting Tianmuli. In recent years, many cities in mainland China have become fashionable to name commercial districts with \"Li\" (里), inviting businesses like fashion apparel, art and culture, tea drinks, and restaurants to settle in, creating new consumption scenarios with multiple functions for \"eating, shopping, and playing.\" Tianmuli in Hangzhou's Xihu District is one such example. This place has many popular F&B brands, a library, and a gallery, and of course, bookstores are indispensable. Tsutaya Books entered Tianmuli in 2020, becoming the first branch of this Japanese chain bookstore brand to open in mainland China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to Tsutaya branches in other cities, the decor and design of this bookstore are dominated by dark wood tones. Upon entering, there is a giant book wall extending all the way to the ceiling, which was originally a very eye-catching feature. Unfortunately, most of the books on the wall are fake, which reduced the overall effect. The bookstore is divided into two levels, upper and lower. Offering coffee, light meals, and exhibition spaces is standard for new-format bookstores today, so there's nothing particularly new about that. It's worth mentioning that this store focuses on art, design, and fashion themes, so books and cultural and creative products in these categories are very abundant, and their classification is more detailed than in other general bookstores. Photography books might be a niche category in some large chain bookstores, but here they are prominently displayed across several large shelves, categorized by photographers from different countries, showing careful curation.\n",

      "In recent years, many regions have encouraged schools to introduce and promote traditional sports, creating a new landscape for school sports development characterized by \"one school, one specialty\" and \"one school, multiple specialties.\" For example, Changling School in Changping District, Beijing, introduced Jiaodou in 2019, achieving good results, and has now incorporated Jiaodou into its school-based curriculum and school sports meets. Traditional sports are diverse, enriching the \"menu\" of campus sports, making them more vivid, lively, and distinctive, thereby fostering a good sports atmosphere.\n",

      "All along, various regions have been working to provide more options for youth sports. The \"Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening and Improving School Sports Work in the New Era,\" issued by the General Offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in 2020, proposed a thorough review of traditional Chinese sports such as martial arts, wrestling, chess, archery, dragon boat racing, shuttlecock kicking, Five Animal Frolics, and dragon and lion dances. These projects are highly engaging and practical, easily stimulating young people's interest in sports and helping them develop lifelong exercise habits.\n",

Throughout the long course of history, the Chinese nation has created a multitude of sports forms, demonstrating diligence, bravery, and intelligence, thereby forming a profound and enduring traditional Chinese sports culture. Promoting traditional sports in schools can provide valuable nourishment for the development of youth sports and the comprehensive growth of students.

      "Upon investigation, it was found that Tian Zhihui, as a leading Party member and cadre of a state-owned enterprise, lost his ideals and convictions, forgot his original aspirations and mission, with political problems intertwined with economic problems, and corruption coexisting with malpractices, truly acting as a \"moth\" within a state-owned enterprise. He violated political discipline by privately reading books with serious political issues, colluding with others, transferring and concealing assets, and resisting organizational review and investigation; disregarding the spirit of the Central Eight-point Regulation, he repeatedly accepted banquets and travel services provided by private business owners, and improperly flew in first class; violated organizational principles by failing to truthfully explain issues during organizational talks; violated integrity requirements by accepting gifts that could affect the impartial performance of official duties; had an improper family conduct, failing to manage and educate his wife and son, with a severely negative impact. He had no bottom line regarding discipline and law, allowed his personal desires to inflate, engaged in self-enrichment through the enterprise, extensively conducted power-for-money transactions, used his authority to seek benefits for others in project contracting, engineering payment settlements, and other areas, and illegally accepted huge bribes from others; and offered bribes to others to gain improper personnel benefits.\n",
      "Tian Zhihui seriously violated the Party's political discipline, the spirit of the Central Eight-point Regulation, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, and lifestyle discipline, violated national laws and regulations, and is suspected of bribery and accepting bribes. Furthermore, he showed no signs of restraint even after the 18th, 19th, and even 20th National Congresses of the Communist Party of China. His case is serious in nature, has a severely negative impact, and warrants severe punishment. In accordance with the \"Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China,\" the \"Supervision Law of the People's Republic of China,\" the \"Law of the People's Republic of China on Administrative Punishments for Public Officials,\" and other relevant regulations, after deliberation by the Standing Committee meeting of the Gansu Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and with the approval of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, it was decided to expel Tian Zhihui from the Party; adjust his retirement benefits in accordance with regulations; confiscate his illicit gains from disciplinary violations and illegal activities; and transfer his suspected criminal issues to the procuratorial organs for review and prosecution in accordance with the law, with all involved assets transferred concurrently.\n",

Bailian Group's first batch of five \"Yixiaotu\" convenience breakfast stores and five mobile breakfast carts were launched across the city, also opening a new chapter for Bailian Yike's \"new retail + breakfast\" 2.0 upgrade model. On the morning of the 19th, a Youth Daily reporter walked onto the bustling city streets, scanned a code to register, ordered online and picked up from a locker, ate freshly made food, with an average order fulfillment speed of 2 minutes and 20 seconds, experiencing a brand new \"breakfast revolution\" brought by \"Yixiaotu\". Around 8 AM on the morning of August 19th, the Yike store near Exit 5 of Shanghai's Xinzha Road Metro Station was bustling with people. As a high-traffic area during morning rush hour, the Xinzha Road Metro Station exit was crowded with people, and this \"Yixiaotu\" convenience breakfast store, officially launched on the 18th, was quite eye-catching. The reporter observed that both Chinese and Western breakfast options were complete and varied at the open counter, with the highlight of the freshly made breakfast being egg pancakes. Staff members worked quickly, spreading the egg and batter mixture into a nice round shape on the pan, which soon turned golden, completing the preparation in two or three minutes. Freshly bought and made breakfast also included local Shanghai favorites such as fried dumplings, 'youdunzi' (fried vegetable fritters), fresh meat mooncakes, sesame balls, and soy milk with fried dough sticks. Western breakfast options were also abundant, with American coffee, milk, sandwiches, toast, hot dogs – a full cabinet display of various Western breakfast items. Faced with such a dazzling array of Chinese and Western breakfast varieties, one could instantly fall into \"choice paralysis\"; the store offers over 130 breakfast varieties in total, with average set meal prices under 10 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the five \"convenience breakfast stores\" across the city, five mobile breakfast carts (prototypes) also departed simultaneously on the 18th from No. 1 Yaohan, Garden Plaza Industrial Park, Zhonghuan Bailian Shopping Center, KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community), and ZL Industrial Park. The mobile breakfast carts also offer over 70 selected breakfast items, covering fresh milk, freshly baked goods, healthy cereals, Chinese dim sum, etc., achieving a blend of Chinese and Western styles and rich variety. Considering consumers' emphasis on healthy and safe eating, special health-preserving products like handmade purple sweet potato steamed buns and multi-grain steamed buns have been added, which are very popular among young white-collar workers and middle-aged and elderly people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the five convenience breakfast stores and five mobile breakfast carts launched by Yike \"Yixiaotu\" have been strategically located in various districts of Shanghai, including Pudong, Huangpu, Jing'an, Putuo, Hongkou, Yangpu, Baoshan, and Songjiang. It is reported that by the end of the year, Yike will also establish 40 \"Yixiaotu\" breakfast stores (20 of which will be 'online order, locker pickup' mode) and 20 \"Yixiaotu\" mobile breakfast carts across the city. Through high-density and widespread coverage, they aim to become the main force in upgrading Shanghai's \"breakfast project\" and create a golden brand for urban breakfast.\n",

      "Further comprehensively deepening reform is the extension of comprehensively deepening reform measures in terms of breadth and depth, and it is the inevitable path to achieving Chinese modernization. At the same time, further comprehensively deepening reform is also an inherent requirement for combining the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities, showcasing the Chinese Communist Party's spirit and character of advancing with the times, and possessing profound logical implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the dimension of theoretical logic, further comprehensively deepening reform fully embodies the guiding role of Marxism's basic principles on social change in China's development process, and implements the specific requirements of combining theory with practice. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized promoting a better adaptation between the relations of production and productive forces, the superstructure and the economic base, and national governance and social development, to provide strong impetus and institutional guarantees for Chinese modernization. It can be seen that the content of further comprehensively deepening reform is more focused on the realities of China's social development, more focused on improving national economy and people's livelihoods, and more focused on the establishment and improvement of various systems and mechanisms. It comprehensively sorts out the key points and difficulties of further deepening reform, ensuring that reform achieves solid results, better transforming the relations of production, and promoting the conversion of new quality productive forces into a strong impetus for the development of Chinese modernization. Advancing Chinese modernization through further comprehensively deepening reform embodies the theoretical logic of Marxist materialism, and is committed to promoting comprehensive development and progress in all fields of China under the guidance of Marxist theory, thereby solidifying a strong theoretical foundation for the development of Chinese modernization.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the dimension of historical logic, further comprehensively deepening reform has opened a new historical chapter for reform and opening up in the new era. From the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee to the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee, and then to the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, for the Chinese Communist Party, which is committed to long-term governance and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, reform and opening up is an ongoing process, not a completed one. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee made the major decision on reform and opening up, laying a solid foundation for socialist modernization. At the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee, the major decision and deployment of the \"Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reform\" was made, establishing the \"four pillars and eight beams\" for comprehensively deepening reform. Entering the new era, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, inheriting the past and forging ahead, all Chinese Communists have been enterprising and overcoming difficulties under the great achievements of reform and opening up, writing a new chapter for the great cause of reform and opening up. To promote further comprehensively deepening reform, a series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new conclusions have been put forward, further deepening the connotation of reform. The \"Decision\" made by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee is a further reinforcement and deepening of the goals of Chinese modernization and comprehensively deepening reform, while also demonstrating the Party's determination and confidence in further comprehensively deepening reform, thus embarking on a new journey of reform to advance Chinese modernization in the new era. This is a call of the times and a historical inevitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the dimension of practical logic, further comprehensively deepening reform answers the question of how to further implement the new development philosophy in the new era and make development better adapt to changes in society's principal contradiction. Further comprehensively deepening reform is China's strategic choice to address multiple challenges and opportunities at present. Its core logic lies in actively responding to the new scientific and technological revolution, industrial transformation, and the new expectations of the people through reform, ensuring the steady advancement of Chinese modernization. Facing a complex and interwoven international situation and the trend of a new scientific and technological revolution, further comprehensively deepening reform has become an inevitable requirement for development. The \"Decision\" specifies phased reform goals up to 2035 and \"seven focuses\" for reform goals in different areas. Among the phased reform goals up to 2035, the \"Decision\" closely follows the main axis of further comprehensively deepening reform, clearly stating \"basically achieving socialist modernization, laying a solid foundation for comprehensively building a great modern socialist country by the middle of this century.\" These phased goals are consistent with the strategic arrangements of the Party's 19th and 20th National Congresses, demonstrating the magnificent prospect of further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization. The above goals and focal points clarify the key areas and important aspects of further comprehensively deepening reform. It is necessary to focus on key links, commit to improving fundamental and long-term systems and mechanisms, and strive to enhance the modernization level of social governance systems and governance capabilities.\n",

Recently, Luckin Coffee's target for combating counterfeiting – Thai Luckin Coffee – claimed on overseas social media that Luckin had failed in its rights protection efforts in Thailand. Luckin Coffee had sued the relevant infringing party in 2021 and won in the first instance in 2022, but on that day, a reporter from Yicai did not find the latest judgment result on the Thai court system platform, and Luckin Coffee also remained silent on the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reporter noted that on overseas social media, Thai Luckin Coffee cited a media report, indicating that multiple Thai media outlets reported that on December 1, the Thai Central Intellectual Property and International Trade Court announced its final judgment on the case concerning China's Luckin Coffee Co. Ltd. suing Thailand's 50R Group for trademark and copyright infringement, and claimed that Luckin Coffee lost the case. However, the article did not disclose a clear source. After multiple inquiries by the reporter, no clear source report of the relevant incident was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, the reporter checked the case system of the Thai Intellectual Property and International Trade Court and found that Luckin Coffee had sued multiple defendants in Thailand in 2021 because on July 29, 2021, Luckin Coffee China applied for the \"Luckin Coffee\" trademark registration with the Thai Intellectual Property Department and planned to conduct business in Thailand, but found that multiple related trademarks had already been preemptively registered. At the same time, on March 28, 2019, the defendant established Luckin Coffee (Thailand) Co., Ltd. in Thailand, and began operating Luckin Coffee stores in December 2020. Luckin Coffee sued to demand the revocation of their trademark registrations and requested the relevant parties to cease using the aforementioned trademarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 24, 2022, the Thai court announced its first-instance judgment, ruling in favor of Luckin Coffee China and ordering the revocation of the relevant trademark registrations and instructing the two defendants to cease using the trademark. The defendants filed an appeal on March 24, 2023, and the case was heard again on November 30, 2023, but the Thai court system has not released the appellate judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2021, domestic netizens have successively posted photos claiming that Luckin Coffee had opened stores in Thailand. Subsequently, Luckin Coffee also issued a statement on August 9, 2022, to debunk the rumor, stating that the former were counterfeit stores. In social media photos, the reporter saw that the counterfeit stores used Luckin's English name and rotated the deer head logo to the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that in recent years, Luckin has also accelerated its plans for overseas expansion. At the recent third-quarter earnings conference, Luckin management revealed that as of September 30, the company's total number of stores reached 13,273, with a net increase of 2,437 new stores in a single quarter, including 11 stores in Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Luckin Coffee Chairman and CEO Guo Jinyi revealed at the earnings conference that Luckin Coffee would continue to expand into overseas markets in the future, based on his subsequent speech content, Luckin Coffee still hopes to increase investment in the Chinese market to further expand its leading advantage. On that day, Guo Jinyi stated that as competition in China's coffee market intensifies, Luckin Coffee will continue to increase the number of stores in high-tier cities, and at the same time, accelerate the expansion into sinking markets through a partnership model to further expand its market share.\n",

      "\n",
      "Analysis\n",
      "Researchers have developed a new material, \"lunar asphalt,\" suitable for the lunar environment. In a simulated space environment laboratory, robotic equipment heated the \"lunar asphalt\" and paved the surface of the \"lunar road.\" The wheels of a simulated lunar rover then drove on the \"lunar road\" 900 times, covering a total distance of 720 meters, without causing damage that would affect wheel operation. It is generally believed that the lunar surface, covered with regolith, is detrimental to lunar exploration missions: equipment such as lunar rovers can easily wear down when rubbing against regolith particles; regolith particles entering the interior of equipment could damage precision components; and electrostatically charged regolith particles could potentially have adverse effects on astronaut health. In the future, if roads can be built on the lunar surface, it is expected to enhance the safety of lunar habitation and exploration, reduce equipment wear, alleviate maintenance burdens, and also help improve the working environment for instruments.

      "The Development Zone immediately contacted the Jin'an Ecological Environment Bureau and organized staff to investigate and verify the report. An on-site inspection confirmed the presence of 19 stone cutting workshops, none of which were equipped with dust or wastewater collection and treatment facilities. They were verified as \"scattered, polluting, and illegal\" sites. To prevent these stone cutting workshops from continuing to pollute the environment, the Development Zone and the Gushan Town Government, in conjunction with joint law enforcement departments, shut down and demolished the 19 stone cutting workshops at this location, achieving immediate rectification. The vacated land, combined with nearby plots, was re-planned, resulting in a total land area of 58.8 mu. This area is designated for the construction of seven office buildings and one hotel for the Hutang Science and Technology Innovation Park.\n",

What they can make themselves gives them a cost advantage. Purchased items also get the most favorable prices. German Bosch supplies BYD with things at the lowest prices, a top-tier customer level. Other domestic enterprises do not have this treatment. BYD has confidence, not just because it has capital, but crucially because it has technology in hand. Technology can be exchanged for capital, and technology can also be exchanged for technology. If you don't have technology, others will set the price. If you have technology and others need it, you can negotiate. This is because BYD took its self-made ESP to bargain with Bosch, meaning if you don't give me the most favorable price, I'll make it myself, and if production capacity increases, I might even sell it to other car companies. An enterprise with technology should be this formidable. The King of Qin swept through the six realms; as for which six, imagine for yourself.\n",

      "First, it clarifies the professional standards for intermediary institutions. Intermediary institutions are required to adhere to the principles of honesty, diligence, and objectivity, and are prohibited from engaging in illegal or irregular activities such as assisting companies in financial fraud, fraudulent issuance, or irregular information disclosure. The documents they produce and issue must not contain false records, misleading statements, or significant omissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it clarifies the charging principles for intermediary institutions. Intermediary institutions should set reasonable charging standards based on market principles, taking into account factors such as workload and resource investment. Securities firms' sponsorship businesses and accounting firms' audit businesses shall not condition their charges on the outcome of the public issuance of stocks. Law firms should charge in accordance with relevant regulations on lawyer service fees issued by the State Council's judicial administration and other departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it clarifies the regulatory measures. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, Ministry of Finance, judicial administration, and other departments should strengthen information communication and coordination, and according to their respective responsibilities, strengthen the regulation of intermediary institutions' professional conduct in accordance with the law. When necessary, they can take measures such as joint on-site inspections to investigate and punish illegal and irregular activities in accordance with the law. Administrative penalties such as warnings, fines, and suspension of related businesses can be imposed on intermediary institutions and their personnel who violate the regulations. Administrative penalties such as warnings and fines can also be imposed on issuers and their controlling shareholders or actual controllers who violate the regulations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, along the Kerqin River in Qiemo County, thousands of grey cranes take flight into the rising sun, beginning their daily search for food. \"The food sources here are rich and diverse.

      "In recent years, Qiemo County has vigorously promoted ecological protection projects, cumulatively afforesting 145,700 acres in the Taklamakan Desert, successfully creating a 130,000-acre green corridor spanning 23 kilometers. This green lifeline acts as a robust ecological barrier, effectively blocking the rampant winds and sands while bringing about a dramatic transformation in the local ecological environment and natural resources. Under its protection, the grasslands and waters along both banks of the Kerqin River are gradually recovering, becoming an ideal overwintering habitat and energy supply station for birds, attracting rare bird species such as grey cranes to flock in for refuge and reproduction.\n",

      "Nazhakaituli introduced that since the first grey cranes landed in Qiemo County for overwintering, their numbers have been steadily increasing. This year, the number of overwintering grey cranes has risen from the initial 3,000 to more than 6,000. Meanwhile, the number of wild bird species migrating to Qiemo County annually has increased to six.\n",

      "In recent years, wireless phone chargers, with their convenience of not needing to plug in data cables and allowing phones to charge with a simple placement, have gained favor among many consumers. How do the performance and quality of wireless phone chargers that claim to offer \"shell-on fast charging, smart matching compatibility, and efficient low-temperature charging\" stand? On July 23, the Shanghai Consumer Council released the results of a comparative test on wireless phone chargers: 6 out of 18 samples failed to meet the test requirements for foreign matter detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6 Samples Fail Foreign Matter Detection**\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that this comparative test purchased 18 wireless phone chargers from multiple e-commerce platforms. Among them, 4 were original chargers from Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, and vivo, while 14 were non-original chargers from brands like Public Bull, Green League, and Baseus. The prices of the samples ranged from 29.9 yuan to 329 yuan, with the average price of original samples being 289 yuan and non-original samples being 90 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comparative test focused on aspects such as product safety and charging performance, which are of concern to consumers. Based on national standards, the samples underwent tests for heat generation, charging protection, and foreign matter detection. Additionally, consumer usage scenarios were simulated to compare charging times and transmission distances among different samples, and the appearance and labels of the samples were inspected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test found that in terms of safety, 6 out of 18 samples failed to meet the test requirements for foreign matter detection. According to the national mandatory standard GB 4943.1-2022, the safety of the samples was tested, revealing that the heat generation and charging protection indicators of all 18 samples met the standards. The highest temperature during charging ranged from 29.7 to 67.0 °C, and all samples automatically switched to low power mode after full charging. However, 6 samples failed the foreign matter detection test, unable to effectively identify metal objects approaching and stop charging, resulting in object temperatures exceeding the standard limit. These 6 samples that failed the safety test were excluded from further performance comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Domestic Phone Original Chargers Have Higher Power**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Council pointed out that charging time is one of the performances most concerned by consumers, and the length of charging time is closely related to the power of the charger. Among the 12 samples that passed the safety test, 3 had a power of 50W, 6 had a power of 15W, and 3 had a power of 10W. The test found that original chargers all implemented private protocols, providing 50W charging power for corresponding models of their own brands. The Huawei, Xiaomi, and vivo samples could all provide 50W charging power for their respective brand's phones, while the Apple sample could provide 15W charging power. Non-original chargers could only implement open protocols, with power mostly ranging between 10W and 20W.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the higher the power, the shorter the charging time. In this comparative test, consumer usage scenarios were simulated to observe the time it took for the samples to charge a load phone from 0% to 100%. The test found that when original chargers were used with fast-charging-supported models of the same brand as the load phone, the charging times for the Huawei, Xiaomi, and vivo samples were all within 2 hours, with Huawei taking only 64 minutes, performing the best. Apple's charging time was approximately 2.7 hours. When Huawei and Apple chargers were swapped, Huawei's 50W wireless charger could provide 11W of power for charging an Apple phone, taking about 2.9 hours; Apple's 15W wireless charger could provide 6.8W of power for charging a Huawei phone, taking nearly 5 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the 8 non-original chargers, the test uniformly selected two popular phones (HUAWEI P60 and iPhone 14) as load phones. It was found that the 8 samples had significantly different charging times, with an average time of about 3 to 5 hours. Specifically, the charging times for HUAWEI P60 ranged from 2 hours 47 minutes to 5 hours 35 minutes, and for iPhone 14, they ranged from 2 hours 58 minutes to 4 hours 32 minutes. ZMI, Green League, and Yishe's samples charged both load phones within 3 hours, performing relatively well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test also found that to reduce battery wear, some chargers and phones have the function of automatically adjusting charging power, such as fast charging at high power until 90% is reached, then switching to trickle charging at low power until 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the ability to charge without removing the phone case, known as \"case-on charging,\" is a major selling point of wireless chargers. In this comparative test, two common phone cases were selected for verification testing, and A4 paper was used to simulate a phone case. The maximum thickness of A4 paper that could be placed between the phone and the wireless charger while still being able to charge was tested as the maximum transmission distance of the sample. The test found that all 12 samples could support \"case-on charging,\" with maximum transmission distances ranging from 3.9 mm to 7.6 mm, and an average maximum transmission distance of 6.0 mm. Among them, the maximum transmission distances of 4 original chargers were all above 6.0 mm.\n",

      "**Consumer Reminder**\n",
      "\n",
      "For Phone \"Fast Charging,\" Original Products Are Better\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shanghai Consumer Council reminds consumers to pay attention to the power of wireless chargers and the power supported by their phones before purchasing. Actual charging is performed at the lower power between the two, with matching being optimal. Due to protocol restrictions, 50W high-power chargers are mostly original products, capable of fast charging for corresponding models of the same brand. Non-original products claiming \"fast charging\" mostly have a maximum power of only 15W.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original products charge faster but are more expensive, while non-original products charge slower but are less expensive. It is suggested to purchase based on individual needs. Product outer packaging labels should clearly state the manufacturer's name, maximum power, model specifications, and other information. Consumers can carefully inspect the appearance and smell to ensure there are no gaps or odors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing chargers with heat dissipation fans and good heat dissipation can prevent the charging power from being limited by the temperature control system due to high temperatures, thus ensuring charging efficiency. Magnetic objects (such as the magnetic strips or chips on credit cards or smart keys) placed close by may cause product damage and affect charger performance. It is recommended to avoid placing magnetic or metal objects on the charger's surface for extended periods to prevent device overheating or malfunctions. (Liu Hao)\n",

The release and implementation of the national standard for cotton unloading machines further regulates the production and use of these machines, enhancing the overall level of the cotton processing industry in China. It significantly improves the quality of cotton bale packaging and the efficiency of processing production lines, reduces equipment operating costs, and contributes to the technological advancement of cotton processing equipment. This effectively addresses issues and shortcomings in current intelligent processing systems, promoting industry technological progress.\n",

      "**I. Standard Name:** \"Cotton Unloading Machines\" (GB/T 41229-2021)\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Standard Development Background:**\n",
      "\n",
      "As a core component linking upstream and downstream processes in cotton processing systems, cotton unloading machines play a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of ginning lines. They are an essential prerequisite for enhancing production line efficiency. Currently, China primarily follows the national standard GH/T 1018-1999 \"Cotton Unloading Machines\" set by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. This standard includes specifications for the now-discontinued 125 and 140 model types, which are no longer suitable for modern processing requirements due to the significant increase in cotton processing capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the market, high-yield models like the 180 and 200 types are widely used, but due to the absence of corresponding unloading machine standards, these products operate without a clear regulatory framework across manufacturing, sales, taxation, and user application stages. Therefore, to ensure smooth operations across all cotton processing stages and maximize production line functionality, there is an urgent need for a new national standard for cotton unloading machines. This will meet the demands of technological advancement, energy conservation, emission reduction, and industry development, promoting standardized, informatized, and intensive cotton production models, empowering the cotton industry value chain, and pushing the industry towards high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Main Content of the Standard:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Standard Framework:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   The standard covers: scope, normative references, models, technical requirements, test methods, inspection rules, marking, packaging, storage, and transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scope:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   This standard applies to cotton unloading machines that randomly agglomerate lint cotton.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technical Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Models and Production Capacity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "     The production capacity of cotton unloading machines is related to the size of the dust cage diameter. Therefore, the primary parameter is set as 1/10 of the dust cage roller diameter (mm). With the widespread use of four 171 ginning machines in cotton harvesting lines, the lint cotton processing capacity has reached 6.5 t/h. Considering the processing capacity of major cotton processing enterprises in China, the standard focuses on three models: 180, 200, and 220. Based on suggestions from domestic cotton processing mechanical production enterprises, although the 140 model is rarely used domestically, it is still included to facilitate exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Air Leakage Rate:**\n",
      "\n",
      "     To accelerate energy conservation and emission reduction efforts, domestic cotton processing enterprises have taken relevant measures for pipeline sealing. Based on tests of air leakage rates in existing cotton processing enterprises and considering China's actual cotton processing conditions, the standard sets the air leakage rate at no more than 14%.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Dust Cage Speed:**\n",
      "\n",
      "     With continuous improvements in the level of mechanical equipment manufacturing for cotton processing, mechanical processing errors are becoming smaller, and precision is increasing. The strength and rigidity of dust cages have also improved. A dust cage speed exceeding 20 r/min fully meets strength and rigidity requirements; therefore, the standard no longer sets specific speed requirements for the dust cage.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Quality of Main Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "     The surfaces of the dust cage mesh, pressing cotton rollers, and peeling cotton rollers directly contact the cotton. If these surfaces are not smooth and hook cotton fibers, it can lead to machine blockages affecting production or, in severe cases, fires. Therefore, the standard includes the technical indicator \"cannot hook cotton fibers.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "On April 15th, the 135th session of the China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair) opened in Guangzhou. Building upon the previous year's record-breaking exhibition area and number of participating enterprises, this year's Canton Fair has seen another significant increase in scale, with a total of 29,000 participating companies, continuing the overall trend of becoming more vibrant year after year. According to media statistics, within the first hour of the exhibition hall's opening, more than 20,000 overseas buyers rushed in, with 40% of them being new buyers. Amidst the turmoil in the Middle East causing concerns in the international market, the grand and lively opening of the Canton Fair brings certainty to global trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "This session of the Canton Fair, with the theme of \"Serving High-quality Development and Promoting High-level Opening,\" is being held in three offline exhibitions. As a barometer of China's foreign trade, the outside world first perceives China's strength and determination in development and opening up through the Canton Fair. In fact, since 1957, the Canton Fair has been held twice a year in spring and autumn without interruption, which is unparalleled among major countries. China's persistent goodwill and sincerity towards the world are tangible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Canton Fair has evolved from a window into Chinese manufacturing to a global manufacturing platform. Notably, the first phase of this session's exhibition is themed \"Advanced Manufacturing,\" highlighting advanced industries and technological support, showcasing new types of productivity. Over 5,500 high-quality specialty companies with titles such as national-level high-tech, manufacturing industry champions, and \"Small Giants\" specializing in precision, novelty, and uniqueness, are participating, a 20% increase from the previous session.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is both a natural manifestation of Chinese manufacturing climbing to the mid-high end of the global industrial and value chains and a way to give back to the world, creating more opportunities and benefits. This is how China genuinely interacts with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interaction is far from a one-way output from China to the world. Contrary to some Western media portrayals of China dumping cheap surplus goods on the world, squeezing other countries' development space, and making huge profits, anyone who visits the Canton Fair exhibition site can easily understand why doing business with China is so popular. Taking this session of the Canton Fair as an example, there is a noticeable increase in global retail top 250 companies and large merchants from various countries and regions. These include American companies like Walmart, Belk, and Amazon, French companies such as Auchan, Carrefour, and Schneider, as well as Tesco from the UK and Metro from Germany, with nearly 200 leading companies confirming their participation as a group. If these companies that genuinely do business with China were to paint a picture of the country, it would undoubtedly differ greatly from the China depicted by \"keyboard warriors\" who have never set foot in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidentally, during the opening of this session of the Canton Fair, German Chancellor Scholz was leading a large delegation on a visit to China, and a delegation from China's Ministry of Commerce was discussing economic and trade cooperation with their Italian counterparts. On a larger scale, along the \"Belt and Road,\" cooperation projects are continuously being launched, and business elites from around the world are traveling to and from China on flights, making cooperation with China a trend that cannot be stopped by a small number of Western politicians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canton Fair has opened a door for China and the world to mutually benefit each other, and there is no doubt that it has been highly successful on every level. It can be safely predicted that this year's Canton Fair will see an expected increase in transaction volume. This is both an inherent logical outcome and an inevitable result of the current international political and economic situation. China has the largest scale of motivation for upgrading and transforming its national economy within the global industrial structure transition, which is easy to discern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, for the world, especially in the context of ongoing local conflicts and turmoil, such a comprehensive international trade event with a wide range of sources and good transaction effects, and with considerable credibility, is also an important public good contributed by China. The more uncertain the world situation becomes, the more valuable this trade event becomes.

Among them, the growth rate of private investment turned from a decline to an increase, with private fixed asset investment in China increasing by 0.4% year-on-year from January to February, compared to a decrease of 0.4% in the whole of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, goods imports and exports grew at a faster rate. In the first two months, the total volume of goods imports and exports increased by 8.7% year-on-year, with exports increasing by 10.3%, returning to double-digit growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Employment:** The overall employment situation remained stable, and the residents' consumer price index turned from a decrease to an increase year-on-year. The urban survey unemployment rate was 5.2% in January and 5.3% in February, rising slightly month-on-month, but compared to the same period last year, the urban survey unemployment rate decreased by 0.3 percentage points in both January and February. In February, the residents' consumer price index rose by 1% month-on-month, and year-on-year, it turned from a decrease of 0.8% in the previous month to an increase of 0.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "From January to February, the added value of high-tech manufacturing above the scale increased by 7.5% year-on-year; investment in high-tech industries and technological transformation investment in manufacturing increased by 9.4% and 15.1% year-on-year, respectively; and the real-life retail sales of goods online increased by 14.4% year-on-year...

      "While acknowledging the steady growth in the national economy, Liu Aihua also pointed out that China is currently in a crucial period of economic recovery and transformation, with many external unstable and uncertain factors. Domestic issues such as insufficient effective demand still exist, and the foundation for the economic recovery and improvement needs to be further solidified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry is the cornerstone of economic development. Liu Aihua mentioned that as various policies continue to take effect, industrial production growth has accelerated. However, many industrial enterprises still face significant operational pressures, including insufficient orders and rising costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumption is the primary engine driving economic growth. Since the beginning of the year, market sales have continued to recover, and the potential of service consumption is being rapidly unleashed. \"It is also important to recognize that the foundation for the recovery and expansion of consumption still needs to be consolidated. Residents' consumption capacity and confidence need to be further enhanced, and the quality and structure of supply still require optimization,\" Liu Aihua remarked. She emphasized the need to continue promoting stable consumption growth, enhancing consumption capabilities and willingness, and optimizing the consumption environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to statistical data, the real estate market is still in the midst of adjustment and transformation. In the first two months, real estate development investment decreased by 9% year-on-year, narrowing the gap by 0.6 percentage points compared to the whole of last year. However, in terms of sales, the sales area of new commercial housing nationwide decreased by 20.5% year-on-year, and sales revenue decreased by 29.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the current issues facing China's economic development are problems and growing pains encountered during progress. \"This year, the environment for China's development remains a mix of strategic opportunities and risks, with more favorable conditions than adverse factors,\" as outlined in the Government Work Report.\n",

      "\n",
      "Driving Economic Sustainability and Stability\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The main indicators for January and February account for a relatively small proportion of the full-year total, and the economic trend in the later stages still needs further observation,\" Liu Aihua remarked. She emphasized the importance of actively addressing challenges and driving the economy towards sustained improvement and stability, in accordance with the decisions and deployments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government Work Report sets the expected target for economic growth at around 5% for the whole year. Liu Aihua explained that the Central Committee and the State Council have already made comprehensive deployments for this year's work, clarifying policy orientations and key tasks. The introduction of new measures, such as issuing super-long-term special government bonds, along with the continuous effects of previous policies like lowering the reserve requirement ratio, interest rates, and tax and fee cuts, will contribute to the sustained recovery and improvement of the economy.\n",

      "Developing new-quality productive forces is an intrinsic requirement and important focus for driving high-quality development. The Government Work Report places \"vigorous promotion of the construction of a modern industrial system and acceleration of the development of new-quality productive forces\" as the top priority for the government's work in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherever new-quality productive forces emerge, investments should be directed there, and macroeconomic policies should shift accordingly. For instance, investment in strategic emerging industries is particularly crucial at present. We should make good use of proactive fiscal policy, maintain investment intensity, address institutional obstacles, and continuously release development potential,\" said Liu Xiao, Dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.\n",

      "Industrial production and vocational education can also be the themes of a large museum exhibition. The WorldSkills Museum, which opened on November 6 this year, is the first museum in the world to be named \"WorldSkills\" and is recognized by the WorldSkills Organization. Housed in the historic \"Yongan Warehouse\" on the Yangpu Riverside, which has a history of over a century, the museum boasts more than 2,000 valuable exhibits and will become one of the most important industrial culture exhibition venues in Shanghai and even China.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Comprehensive Display of WorldSkills\n",
      "\n",
      "On a workday in late November, a reporter from First Financial arrived at the Yangpu Riverside. At the west side of the Yangpu Bridge, visitors were queuing up to enter the newly opened WorldSkills Museum. On the large lawn to the west, children were playing around a boat-shaped sculpture. On the Flag Square, more than a hundred flagpoles were ready for the 2026 WorldSkills Competition in Shanghai.\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of elderly cyclists parked their bikes beside the museum and entered together with the reporter. They had come to see the museum's fame, with several retired workers chatting as they viewed the exhibits. Wearing the cycling outfit of the Shanghai Elderly Physical Association, Ms. Shenyang pointed to several exhibits in the carpentry lathe section and said, \"This is what we used in the factory back then!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this newly established museum, visitors will witness the history of the evolution of human production skills and industrial technology, learn about the origins of the WorldSkills competition and its development into the WorldSkills Organization and the WorldSkills Competition, and feel the impact of vocational skills education on individuals, families, cities, countries, and the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WorldSkills Museum building has four floors, with the first floor featuring an introduction hall and temporary exhibition hall, the second and third floors dedicated to permanent exhibitions, and the fourth floor housing a skills practice experience area and a multi-functional hall. There is also a \"Skills Cafe\" on the side of the first floor. The building itself, the Yongan Warehouse, was originally the warehouse of the Shanghai Yongan Textile Company, a \"twin tower\" structure consisting of two four-story warehouses designed by a British trading company and completed in 1922. It has served as the site of the Shangcotton 29 Factory and the Shanghai Textile Raw Material Yangpu Warehouse, among others. The building is also one of the 66 immovable cultural heritage protection points in Yangpu District. The western half of the twin towers is now the WorldSkills Museum, with a planned area of approximately 10,920 square meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the museum, the industrial legacy is visually clear, with the concrete columns, walls, staircases, and other elements retaining the appearance of a factory warehouse. New designs have been integrated, with automatic escalators, display areas, resting seats, and public art all featuring a minimalist style.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the center of the first floor, the large-scale theme art installation \"World Engine\" resembles a precision instrument in constant motion. According to designer Lu Ziqi, the installation is composed of two circular rings forming an infinite loop structure, symbolizing the \"engine driving the development of WorldSkills.\" The seven tracks and 63 metal balls within the mechanism represent the seven continents and the 63 events of the WorldSkills Competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and third-floor exhibition halls introduce the history of the WorldSkills Competition in chronological order and categorize the development of vocational skills. The exhibits are divided into six core areas: Tools and Our World, A Global Movement for Success, Skills Development in China, Building a Better World with Skills, Skills and Fundamental Science, and Skills and the Industrial Revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a project that gathers the wisdom of many, almost all of the museum's exhibits were donated by contestants, coaches, teachers, sponsors, and other members of the WorldSkills Organization family. Starting in 2018, WorldSkills Organization Project Coordinator Nuria Portland was responsible for researching, collecting exhibits, and overseeing the exhibition setup. She and her team overcame the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and collected over 2,000 exhibits from 39 WorldSkills Organization member countries, regions, and global partners. Over 800 of these were on display at the opening, and based on the reporter's experience, it would take about two hours to carefully view them all.\n",

      "A Milestone in Vocational Education\n",
      "\n",
      "In the WorldSkills Competition Timeline area, the reporter saw posters showcasing the competition's highlights from the first contest in Madrid, Spain, in 1950, to the 2022 WorldSkills Special Competition (held in multiple countries due to the pandemic), the 2024 competition in Lyon, France, and the upcoming 2026 event in Shanghai.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1957 Madrid Competition poster depicted workers operating machine tools, while the 1995 Lyon Competition poster proclaimed \"Skills! We are the best!\" The 2005 Helsinki Competition poster in Finland featured modular units like a Rubik's Cube, foreshadowing creativity, and the 2007 Shizuoka Competition poster in Japan showed five young people from different professions standing shoulder to shoulder, showcasing the brilliance of individuality through craftsmanship.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Brief History of Human Technology area, visitors can trace the progress of tools and production from the simple stone tools of prehistory to humans landing on the moon. The WorldSkills Organization's inception and the competition's establishment were driven by the need to rebuild homes in Europe after World War II. Spain, severely affected by civil war in the 1940s and World War II, faced significant economic and social losses over a decade. To cultivate more young people during reconstruction, vocational skills education began to receive attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first significant exhibits in the WorldSkills Museum relates to the origins of the WorldSkills Competition. In the 1940s, Spain's \"Youth Front\" political party organized vocational skills competitions for young people across the country and held regional competitions. In 1950, with the support of the Spanish government, some Portuguese young apprentices came to Madrid to compete with Spanish youth. In 1953, five European countries accepted an invitation to compete at the Santa Paloma Vocational Training Institute in Madrid, with 66 contestants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through a newsreel short titled \"Skills Olympics\" provided by the Spanish Film Archive, as well as newspapers, letters, photos, and other valuable exhibits, including interview videos with German and British contestants who are now in their 70s and the tools they used, visitors can feel the excitement of those times. Photographs, letters, and belongings of Francisco Albert Vida, the Spanish founder of the WorldSkills Organization, and Fred Hill, a Briton, showcase how their passion for craftsmanship and education drove skills exchange to become a grand endeavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "After more than half a century of growth, the WorldSkills Competition expanded from Spain to Germany, Italy, Ireland, the UK, France, and other European countries before going global. The number of contestants grew from 20-plus in 1950 to over 1,300 today. Social and personal services, creative arts, and information and communication technology have also entered the competition arena. The exhibition showcases this process through a large number of records, tools, and contestant highlights from past competitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time of the 2005 Helsinki Competition, the rules changed, introducing projects like beauty and web design, and the Global Skills Village made its debut, with China and India sending delegations to participate. The competition further recognized the significance of vocational education. This competition is considered a milestone in the history of the WorldSkills Competition, and the WorldSkills Museum displays the gold, silver, and bronze medals and winning awards from this event.\n",

      "\"Made in China\" Demonstrates Strength in the Competition\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, China joined the WorldSkills Organization. Over the past decade, Team China's performance in the competition has made great strides, and the competition has connected educational resources, employment opportunities, and technical research fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WorldSkills Museum exhibits items from China's first participation in the 2011 competition, including the lanyard and commemorative hanger, participant badge, and other items exchanged with other contestants by Li Qin, the web design project contestant. In this competition, the Chinese team sent six participants, and Pei Xianfeng won the silver medal in welding, China's first medal in the WorldSkills Competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Yang Shanwei won the gold medal in automotive repair at the WorldSkills Competition in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, while he was a student at the Shanghai Yangpu Vocational Technical School. Yangpu District has accumulated profound experience in vocational education, becoming a center for vocational education in China and a training base for WorldSkills competitions. The Shanghai Publishing and Printing Vocational College, also located in Yangpu District, has trained multiple contestants for the printing media project of the WorldSkills Competition. By the 2019 WorldSkills Competition in Kazan, Russia, Team China topped the medal table with 16 gold, 14 silver, 5 bronze, and 17 winning awards, demonstrating the strength of \"Made in China.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the WorldSkills Museum also dedicates a significant exhibition area to showcasing the development of Chinese craftsmanship throughout history, revealing the close relationship between technical education and economic and social development. From house construction, carpentry, and pottery firing to modern manufacturing, numerous old photos, tools, publications, and infographics, as well as hands-on projects like mortise and tenon puzzles and rubbings, allow visitors to experience the fun of ancient Chinese crafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Building a Better World with Skills,\" \"Skills and Fundamental Science,\" and \"Skills and the Industrial Revolution\" exhibits on the third floor of the museum display classic industrial machinery, products, and processes from various industries, with many offering hands-on experiences, such as the power water purification system, logging, painting protection equipment, automotive painting, and welding. The reporter observed that interactive games like spray gun graffiti, food cutting, and decorative carving, primarily aimed at children and teenagers, as well as touchable devices like trains and telephones, were quite popular. The practice experience area on the fourth floor of the museum offers several sessions daily with limited slots, which can be booked in advance via the \"WorldSkills Museum\" mini-program.\n",

      "Sixty-five years ago, Wang Fuqiu, a mountaineer from Zhoukou, Henan, successfully climbed Mount Everest from the north side, becoming the first Chinese person to reach the summit. He and his teammates also achieved the first-ever human ascent of Everest from the north. Sixty-five years later, Sun Ning, a young woman in her 20s also from Zhoukou, followed in her predecessor's footsteps and crossed the 8,848.86-meter mark for the third time, becoming the first Henan woman to summit Everest three times.\n",
      "What drives her to measure the 8,848.86-meter peak multiple times?\n",
      "\"The land that gave me birth and raised me has given me a lot of strength,\" Sun Ning said. \"Taking one step at a time, as long as you persist, you will see your own 'first' eventually.\"\n",
      "Summit\n",
      "At the end of May, in a tea house in Zhengzhou, journalists met Sun Ning, who had recently completed her Everest ascent.\n",
      "Wearing a simple windbreaker and sports pants, with a backpack on her shoulders and a baseball cap on her head, Sun Ning hurried in from outside, looking every bit the college student, exuding youthful vigor.\n",
      "Her face was bare, with a dark complexion showing signs of fatigue, and several dark marks were clearly visible.\n",
      "\"I was still applying ointment before coming here,\" Sun Ning said with a quick wit, suddenly transporting us to the moment she was crawling up the ice wall, slowly climbing towards the summit.\n",
      "5,800 meters, 6,500 meters, 7,300 meters... Carrying a weight of several dozen kilograms and wearing thick mountaineering clothes and boots, with increasing altitude came lower temperatures and more severe oxygen deprivation, making every step an extraordinary challenge for the mountaineers.\n",
      "\"Especially after reaching an altitude of 8,000 meters, it feels like the end of the world,\" Sun Ning described the sensation. \"It's an extreme test of both body and spirit.\" With sheer cliffs and few footholds, they could only pull themselves up using the ropes, taking a breath when exhausted while lying on the ice wall.\n",
      "At an altitude of 8,600 meters, mountaineers encounter a major challenge on the north side—the Second Step. It is a rock wall several meters high, almost vertical, once called an \"insurmountable chasm.\"\n",
      "\"My feet were full of blisters, and behind me was an abyss thousands of meters deep,\" Sun Ning recalled. \"I was so nervous that I was shaking all over, and I started crying out of fear. I stuffed myself with quick-acting heart pills, energy gels, and painkillers, cried my eyes out, and then continued forward.\"\n",
      "When she passed the Third Step, she looked up and saw her two teammates approaching the summit, appearing to enter the clouds, a breathtaking sight.\n",
      "On May 24, after overcoming countless hardships, she finally reached the highest point.\n",
      "On May 25, 65 years ago, Wang Fuqiu and his teammates successfully summited Everest from the north. Across more than half a century, the two children of Central China seemed to engage in a dialogue across time at the top of the world.\n",
      "\"At that moment, I felt a deeper connection with the mountain, as if the snow mountain had accepted me,\" Sun Ning said. Like many mountaineers, she does not use the word \"conquer,\" believing that \"the only thing people can conquer is their past selves.\"\n",
      "This was Sun Ning's first time summiting Everest from the north side. In 2019 and 2023, she had successfully reached the summit twice from the south side. Among her four ascents, three were successful, while in 2021, she and her teammates had to abandon their attempt at an altitude of 7,300 meters due to special circumstances.\n",
      "\"For me, reaching the summit of Everest is not an endpoint but a new starting point,\" she said. \"It's like opening a brand new door, giving me even more courage to move forward, as nothing can stop me now.\"\n",
      "The world's highest peak, like a strict mentor, has left a profound mark on Sun Ning's life.\n",
      "Pursuit\n",
      "From the foot of Everest to its peak, Sun Ning walked for six days and five nights in the midst of white snow. From Laozi's hometown of Luyi to Everest, she has spent over a decade pursuing her dreams.\n",
      "Sun Ning has always been curious and adventurous, enjoying painting and often venturing to mountains and rivers to sketch. She was deeply fascinated by nature.\n",
      "\"In college, I often participated in various hiking trips, which is how I got into mountaineering,\" Sun Ning recalled. She explored many places, including numerous routes in the Taihang Mountains, the Qinling Aotai line, and Wutai Mountain, staying in youth hostels and traveling on a tight budget.\n",
      "The further she went, the wider her world became, and Sun Ning harbored even bigger dreams. In 2012, when she was 22, she stood at the foot of Everest for the first time. With the high winds of the plateau blowing snow particles against her windbreaker, she gazed at the towering peak and felt a seed of determination sprout in her heart—to one day reach the top.\n",
      "She began measuring her dreams with her footsteps.\n",
      "In 2015, Sun Ning climbed her first snow mountain, the second peak of Mount Siguniang, with an altitude of 5,276 meters. Out of a group of six or seven, only two successfully reached the summit, and she was one of them.\n",
      "From then on, as she put it, she became \"addicted,\" climbing snow mountains every year, from domestic peaks to those in Nepal, with increasingly higher altitudes.\n",
      "In 2018, Sun Ning surpassed 8,000 meters and successfully summited Manaslu, the world's eighth-highest peak. Climbing Everest was then added to her plan.\n",
      "\"After years of climbing, I have matured a lot in terms of skills and psychology,\" Sun Ning said. \"I felt I was ready.\"\n",
      "In May 2019, Sun Ning successfully summited Everest from the south side, becoming the first woman from Henan to reach the top.\n",
      "In 2023, Sun Ning once again successfully summited Everest from the south side. However, when recalling that experience, her expression turned serious, as she had witnessed the deaths of two international teammates during the climb.\n",
      "\"Teammates who were laughing with us just a few days ago suddenly left us,\" she said, her voice heavy with emotion. \"It was shocking, heartbreaking, and hard to believe. It also made us more aware and reflective about life and death.\"\n",
      "Despite the awe, there was no fear, and these experiences did not deter her. After her two successful south side ascents, she remained determined to climb from the north.\n",
      "\"I've always wanted to summit Everest from the north side because I know too many stories behind Everest climbs,\" Sun Ning explained. In 1960, the Chinese mountaineering team successfully reached the summit, but there was no visual record. It wasn't until 15 years later, in 1975, that they climbed Everest again, and the north side ascent held many sincere and complex emotions for Chinese people.\n",
      "In 2021, Sun Ning submitted her application early, eager to climb from the north side.\n",
      "However, at an altitude of 7,300 meters, due to special circumstances, the climbers had to retreat and abandon their summit attempt.\n",
      "\"I'll be back one day,\" Sun Ning said, a promise she made to both Everest and herself. It was not an angry roar but the quiet confidence of a snow mountain.\n",
      "Four years later, she kept her promise. \"Everest once seemed unattainable to me, but I did it,\" she said with determination. \"As long as you dare to dream and take action, anything is possible.\"\n",
      "From Wang Fuqiu to Sun Ning, the legend of Henan people challenging limits and reaching the peak continues.\n",
      "Experience\n",
      "For Sun Ning, climbing Everest is not only a sport that challenges herself but also a life-affirming art project.\n",
      "In 2023, Sun Ning transported flowers by helicopter to the south side of Everest and, at altitudes of 5,000, 7,000, and 8,000 meters, used the flowers to \"sew up\" Everest's cracks.\n",
      "This year, she brought the \"Suspended Sun\" quartet, using performance art, digital imaging, land art, photography, and painting to transform the entire Mount Everest into an exhibition space for an art project.\n",
      "Regarding the different opinions about her art creations, Sun Ning said, \"It's normal for others not to understand me. Art is about enjoying solitude, and you have to strengthen your inner self and gain confidence.\" She remains steadfast in her artistic pursuits.\n",
      "In 2019, after her Everest summit, many companies approached Sun Ning, offering to invest heavily in packaging her as an internet celebrity. Despite the significant expenses of her climbing endeavors, she refused the quick cash, saying, \"That's not what interests me. I want to stay grounded and take my time building my path.\"\n",
      "Instead, she chose to strike out on her own in Shanghai, establishing an art studio.\n",
      "Many people advised her against it, saying that as an unknown, she would never make a name for herself in Shanghai. Sun Ning's response was, \"Young people should dare to ask questions, explore, dream, and find their own direction in practice.\"\n",
      "Aside from mountaineering and art, Sun Ning is also an ambassador for several charitable organizations.\n",
      "In Xiaojin County, Sichuan, home to Mount Siguniang, Sun Ning formed a connection with the area through a climbing trip. From initially buying art supplies for local children and teaching them to paint, she now returns every year to do practical things for them. The place where her dreams began has become her enduring concern.\n",
      "She enjoys skiing, tries scuba diving, learns non-material cultural heritage production, and is always exploring new ventures. She participates in events like the Sohu Extreme Explorer Conference and the Nepalese Embassy activities, visits art exhibitions everywhere, and in her social media posts, she is a lightly made-up, stylish \"fairy,\" showcasing a different kind of beauty from the rugged mountaineer.\n",
      "\"Girls should not be defined,\" Sun Ning said with a maturity beyond her years. \"The breadth of life is infinite, and we should go out and experience it.\"\n",
      "For the future, she has a clear plan. \"I want to climb the '7+2' (referring to the highest peaks on each of the seven continents and the North and South Poles),\" she said. \"I want to start with this Everest climb and touch the highest peaks on each continent, and hike to the North and South Poles.\"\n",
      "In August, she will continue her journey by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa.\n",
      "Free and unfettered, fearless and daring, Sun Ning embodies a saying with her life experiences: Life is about trying different paths, moving forward, and never looking back.\n",

      "Global long-term investors' views on the mainland stock market have begun to shift: the outflow of mainland stocks slowed in late February, and regional active fund managers started to increase their allocations to growth and technology stocks, especially those with a long-only strategy. As the country steps up economic stimulus measures, the mainland stock market has ended a record six consecutive months of foreign outflow. Some banking analyses indicate that the shift in fund flows is not entirely due to the \"national team\" purchasing stocks, which helps alleviate investors' concerns about the sustainability of the rebound from the January low.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to another research report, US and European Asia funds and emerging market funds reduced their underweight positions in China in February. Based on EPFR data, the net outflow of mainland and Hong Kong stocks last month was $2.2 billion, with 95% attributed to investor redemptions, compared to $2.6 billion in January. Some funds have started to reduce their holdings in India, citing overvaluation and that the risk-return should be allocated elsewhere, which is highly beneficial for China to regain its lost share in global portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, some global funds that have been cautious about mainland stocks have recently turned bullish on them due to their cheap valuations, more stable financial and regulatory risks than before, and improving future earnings. This is the most powerful evidence of restored investor confidence in the country. It also suggests that global investors may increasingly believe that the mainland stock market will end its $7 trillion decline and gradually recover economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, for most foreign investors, being overweight (or reallocating) in mainland stocks is more challenging than ever. However, as many investors feel that the worst fears have been alleviated, and with mainland stock valuations at low levels, the additional risk should be very low. The CSI 300 index has risen 5% this year, while it fell 11% last year, making it one of the worst-performing major indices globally. As global investors become net buyers of mainland stocks through the Hong Kong link, this rebound is expected to continue.\n",

      "Talking about \"bumping fists\" and \"fighting fists\" might evoke many memories from the childhoods of those in their 80s and 90s. Nowadays, this game has a new name, \"foot fighting,\" and is carried out as a traditional sports activity in schools across the country, enjoyed by students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foot fighting, martial arts, dragon boat racing, and other activities bring new vitality to school sports, allowing children to strengthen their bodies while gaining a deeper understanding of traditional sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, many regions have encouraged schools to introduce and promote traditional sports, creating a new landscape of school sports development where \"each school has its specialty\" or \"each school has multiple specialties.\" For instance, Changling School in Changping District, Beijing, introduced foot fighting in 2019, achieving excellent results. The school has now incorporated foot fighting into its curriculum and school sports meetings. Traditional sports, with their diverse forms, enrich the \"menu\" of campus sports, making them more dynamic, lively, and distinctive, fostering a positive sports atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts have been made across the country to provide more choices for teenage sports. The Opinions on Fully Strengthening and Improving School Sports Work in the New Era, issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council in 2020, proposes a careful review of Chinese traditional sports projects such as martial arts, wrestling, chess, archery, dragon boat racing, shuttlecock, five-animal exercises, and dragon and lion dancing. These projects are highly engaging and practical, easily sparking teenagers' interest in sports and helping them develop lifelong exercise habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of traditional sports into schools not only benefits the inheritance and development of excellent traditional Chinese culture but also provides valuable nourishment for the comprehensive growth of students in their teenage years. In 2023, the pilot work of martial arts entering schools was launched in seven pilot provinces: Shanghai, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Chongqing, and Yunnan. Students have expressed that through participating in martial arts, they have not only exercised their bodies and tempered their willpower but also gained a deeper understanding of traditional sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "From traditional sports, people understand homesickness, witness inheritance, and observe innovation. As more and more teenagers come to love and engage in these activities, traditional sports will undoubtedly shine with an even more captivating era-specific radiance. (Li Yanfei)\n",

On March 4th, the 2nd Session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) opened in Beijing. Embracing the refreshing spring breeze, over 2,100 national CPPCC members from 34 sectors gathered to deliberate state affairs and offer suggestions for advancing China's modernization. We extend our heartfelt congratulations on the convening of this conference!\n",
      "\n",
      "The historical timeline records the struggles and witnesses the solid steps taken in the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist state. 2023 marks the inaugural year of comprehensively implementing the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Facing an exceptionally complex international environment and the arduous and heavy tasks of reform, development, and stability, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united the whole Party, the military, and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. They have withstood external pressure, overcome internal difficulties, adhered to the general principle of progressing while maintaining stability, deepened overall reform and opening up, and strived to drive economic recovery and development. They have fulfilled the main goals and tasks of economic and social development for the year, achieving hard-won and inspiring results. Over the past year, the CPPCC has earnestly implemented the decisions and deployments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, fully played its role as a specialized consultative body, and focused on key tasks to conduct in-depth investigations, political consultations, and democratic oversight. It has made new contributions to the development of the Party and the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and also the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the CPPCC. The 75 years of practice have proven that the CPPCC is a great achievement of the Communist Party of China in integrating the theories of Marxist-Leninist unified front, party, and democratic politics with China's reality. It is also a great creation by the Communist Party of China in leading the various democratic parties, non-party personalities, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life in the political system. As an organization of the united front, an institution for multi-party cooperation and political consultation, and an essential form of people's democracy, the CPPCC is an essential part of the national governance system and a unique institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. At this new historical starting point, by upholding and developing the CPPCC system and advancing the CPPCC cause, we can integrate the organic combination of Party leadership, united front, and consultative democracy. This will undoubtedly open up new prospects for CPPCC work in the new era and jointly write the glorious chapter of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",

      "General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized that \"advancing the modernization of China in an all-around way and pushing forward the great cause of strengthening the country and national rejuvenation is the central task of the Party and the state in the new era and on the new journey.\" Marching forward along the broad road of Chinese modernization, we are fully aware that the future is bright, but the path ahead will not be smooth sailing. There will inevitably be various foreseeable and unforeseeable risks, challenges, difficulties, and even rough seas and stormy waves. Leveraging the political advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the institutional advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics, mobilizing all positive factors that can be mobilized, and uniting all forces that can be united, we can achieve victory in the historical cause of strengthening the country and national rejuvenation. On the path forward, as long as we unite into \"a piece of hard steel\" under the Party's flag, draw the largest circle of unity for strengthening the country and national rejuvenation, and gather strength through unity and forge ahead through struggle, any wind and waves will not shake our steel will, and any difficulties will not stop our resolute steps. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, like a colossal ship, will certainly break through waves and sail far. (continued on Page 3) (picked up from Page 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Consultative democracy is an essential institutional design for the Party to lead the people in effectively governing the country and ensuring the people's right to rule. The CPPCC is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultative democracy. By steadfastly adhering to the comprehensive leadership of the Communist Party of China, insisting on the organic connection between promoting democracy and increasing unity, and exerting efforts in both suggesting policies and gathering consensus, we can better fulfill the new era's mission and tasks of the CPPCC. This will help to gather immense power for strengthening the country and national rejuvenation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When efforts are combined, even Mount Tai can be moved. We must rally even more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, comprehensively implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the \"two establishments,\" enhance our \"four consciousnesses,\" firm up our \"four confidences,\" and demonstrate our \"two maintenances.\" We should continuously implement the strategic deployments of the 20th National Congress of the CPC, transform the magnificent blueprint of Chinese modernization step by step into beautiful reality. Advancing on the glorious and dream-filled new journey, the CPPCC has a glorious mission and a heavy responsibility. We look forward to all CPPCC members remembering the \"greater good,\" fulfilling their duties diligently, offering true advice, devising good strategies, and providing practical measures. They should contribute further and greater achievements to advancing the modernization of China in an all-around way and pushing forward the great cause of strengthening the country and national rejuvenation.\n",

      "Shizuishan has incorporated the construction of elderly care service systems into its overall economic and social development plans and civil affairs agenda. The city has formulated documents such as the \"Basic Elderly Care Service Checklist\" and the \"Plan for Expanding and Accelerating Healthy Aging\" to comprehensively build a multi-level elderly care service system centered on home-based care, supported by community services and institutional care, and integrated with healthcare. The establishment of a joint conference system for elderly care services and a mechanism for overseeing the development of the healthy aging industry, along with a series of supporting programs, has provided policy guidance for reforms in elderly care. The city has also implemented \"one-card\" distribution for longevity healthcare allowances for those aged 85 and above, expanded the range of high-age subsidies to include all seniors aged 80 and above, and achieved parity in subsidy amounts for low-income seniors in urban and rural areas. Currently, the city has 43 beds per 1,000 seniors, and its efforts in home-based and community elderly care service reforms have been recognized with a State Council commendation, with the \"Elderly Care Service Tour 'Big Fair'\" being selected as an outstanding case in the national pilot program for home-based and community elderly care service reforms.\n",

Using \"digital operations\" as the entry point, the city has built a smart health and elderly care service information platform that connects the municipal elderly care service dispatch and command center, home-based and community elderly care service centers, stations, and points, forming a distinctive \"1+4+N\" elderly care service model through online-offline integrated services. With \"standardized services\" as the foundation, the city has established a smart elderly care nursing training center to comprehensively enhance the skills and service standards of caregivers, promoting the \"Unifying Brand, Unifying Management, Unifying Service, and Unifying Facilities\" (four unifications) among 153 home-based and community elderly care service centers, stations, and points, and creating the \"Yi Xiang·Shizuishan\" elderly care service brand. This brand provides seniors with \"ten assists,\" including meal assistance and cleaning assistance. Leveraging \"diversified supply\" as the growth point, the city has established a rural elderly care monitoring mechanism, addressing the dispersed residence and insufficient surrounding services in rural areas through the \"Rural Elderly Care Service Fair\" model, providing 801 rounds of professional and universal elderly care services to rural left-behind, lonely, empty-nester, and disabled or semi-disabled seniors, thus addressing rural elderly care service gaps. With \"intelligent supervision\" as the innovation point, the city employs methods such as positioning identification and photo collection to monitor the implementation process, standards, and quality of elderly care service projects, ensuring supervised services, measurable performance, and demonstrable results.\n",

The city emphasizes \"living with dignity\" by actively securing project funds to renovate public activity areas in residential communities for senior-friendly adaptations and substantively advancing the senior-friendly renovation of homes for economically disadvantaged and specially difficult seniors. This includes focusing on safe toileting and bathing, convenient indoor mobility, improved home environments, intelligent monitoring, and assistive device fitting for seniors aged 60 and above who are dispersed, disabled, or living alone. The city also highlights talent team building by including elderly care professionals such as caregivers and health management specialists in the directory of urgently needed and scarce occupations, establishing nursing and rehabilitation therapy programs at the Ningxia Medical and Health Vocational College, and fostering a coordinated talent cultivation system in medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, and elderly care. Through hosting municipal elderly care nursing skill competitions and selecting participants for regional and national events, Shizuishan comprehensively enhances the skills of caregivers.

Focusing on educational environments, the city regularly organizes various exhibitions, performances, and public training classes, benefiting over 50,000 seniors annually. Emphasizing residential environment improvements, Shizuishan continues its work in creating national model age-friendly communities, establishing 8 such communities to date, achieving 100% coverage of urban community elderly care service facilities. The city also prioritizes legal dissemination, conducting elderly rights protection legal awareness campaigns during significant time periods like \"Elderly Health Awareness Week\" and \"Respect for the Elderly Month,\" enhancing seniors' legal consciousness. With a focus on the digital environment, Shizuishan introduces smart devices into households to offer customized and convenient products and services, assisting seniors in bridging the digital divide. The city has secured 25 million yuan in project funds for the expansion and renovation of senior universities, creating well-equipped, functional, and reasonably configured senior learning platforms. Over 30 senior education institutions have been established, extending elderly education to townships, streets, villages, and communities. Additionally, Shizuishan encourages the development of elderly volunteer services, supporting the growth of \"Silver Age Mutual Assistance\" volunteer organizations. These initiatives enable healthy, younger seniors to serve their older, disabled, or isolated peers. Through the \"Yi Xiang Big Classroom\" explored at home-based and community elderly care service centers, seniors with special skills are recruited to conduct characteristic classroom activities, forming the \"60 Serving 80\" volunteer service brand.\n",

      "After class, I returned to my office as usual, and there were a few students waiting for me at the door. One of them was a senior who had participated in the graduate school entrance exam this year and performed well. She was scheduled to go to another school for the second round of interviews the next day. She said she needed to see me before she left, or she wouldn't feel right. I talked to her about the interview and gave her some advice. She left with confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I watched her walk away, my thoughts drifted back two years ago. That was when she was a sophomore, and I was teaching ancient Chinese in her class. During class, she seemed distracted and troubled. During the break, I walked up to her, called her name, and asked if she was feeling unwell. She was surprised and said she was fine. After class, she asked if I had time, as she wanted to talk to me. We chatted all the way back to my office. She said she was feeling very down because she hadn't received the scholarship she had hoped for, despite her hard work. She felt disappointed and lost, as if her efforts had not paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I held her hand and listened quietly to her story. Eventually, she started crying and said, \"Teacher, I'm quite introverted and tend to keep things to myself. Today, I felt moved that I could open up to you. I didn't expect that in university, a course instructor like you, in a class of over 120 students, would notice me, an ordinary student, on the first day of class, call out my name, and care for me. Since I started school, no teacher has ever cared for me the way you do. I'm truly moved and don't know how to express these feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After comforting and encouraging her, she left with a smile. In the following classes, she always sat in the front row, asked questions frequently, and told me she had found her direction again and wanted to pursue a graduate degree in linguistics at another school.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day before the graduate exam, she left a letter in my mailbox: \"Teacher, I wanted to see you, but since you were teaching, I didn't want to disturb you. I'm taking the graduate exam tomorrow. I want to tell you that no matter the result, I will accept it calmly. Please don't worry, teacher. I'm no longer the student who couldn't face reality. I've grown up. Time has flown by, and now that the graduate exam is here, it means graduation is near. I feel like I haven't fully enjoyed my university life yet. It's almost over, and I'm feeling a bit nostalgic. Looking back at my journey since entering university, I have some things I want to say to you. If it weren't for your guidance, I might have sunk into despair. My life could have taken a different path. At that time, I thought the only thing I could do was study hard and not disappoint your care for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading this, I realized that in university, students are away from their parents and face many challenges and confusions in their studies and daily lives. Often, when something goes wrong, they blow it out of proportion, feeling that everything is dark and meaningless. In reality, things are not as bad as they think. As I've read somewhere: \"Not all growth has bright and dazzling colors; some growth is destined to be a deep, profound melody.\" They need to learn to face challenges bravely and not avoid them, as it is part of their growth process. At this time, teachers are their strong support system. A teacher's love and guidance can provide significant support and encouragement, helping students approach setbacks optimistically, as Tagore said, \"The world offers me a pain, I offer it a song.\" A teacher's greatest joy is watching students find their direction and move closer to their goals, step by step.\n",

      "In the fight against COVID-19, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation equipment (ECMO) has proven to be a lifesaver for critically ill patients, earning the nickname \"lifesaving device.\" Recently, a domestically developed ECMO device, independently researched and developed by Chinese scientists, has entered the clinical stage, marking a breakthrough in the autonomous production of major medical equipment in China. This advancement has the potential to break the long-standing dependence on imports and high prices, making ECMO more accessible to grassroots hospitals and benefiting more patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of the first domestically produced ECMO in China is a story worth exploring.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Five Years of Hard Work: Compact Yet Powerful Domestic ECMO**\n",
      "\n",
      "A small block measuring less than 0.5 square meters, connected to several specially designed tubes, weighing only 6 kilograms—this is the simple and unassuming appearance of China's first domestically produced ECMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite its compact size, this device should not be underestimated. Not only are all the core components independently developed in China, but the device is also much smaller and lighter than similar imported models, making it highly portable and particularly suitable for emergency transportation in critical situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "ECMO, often referred to as an \"artificial lung,\" is one of the most advanced life-support technologies in the world. Its primary function is to provide external breathing and circulation for patients with acute or severe heart and lung dysfunction, buying valuable time for rescue efforts and earning its reputation as a \"lifesaving device\" for doctors battling against death.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as the number of critical cases increased, the shortage of ECMO devices became a pressing issue. ECMO units were urgently dispatched from various parts of the country to support Wuhan.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, China has long relied on imports for this crucial medical equipment, resulting in high costs for both the devices and their consumables. The industry often uses the metaphor, \"ECMO costs as much as gold.\" Currently, there are no domestic manufacturers producing ECMO devices in China, and all of the country's 400-plus ECMO units are imported. On a global scale, the ECMO market is largely dominated by a few manufacturers from the United States and Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this situation is finally changing. Recently, after five years of scientific research and development by a collaborative team from the National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials and Medical Engineering at Sichuan University, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, and the School of Mechanical Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University, a domestically produced ECMO has successfully been applied clinically, achieving a groundbreaking breakthrough in this field for China.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials and Medical Engineering at Sichuan University, we met with some of the core team members involved in the development of the domestic ECMO. Led by the renowned Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) Fellow Zhang Xingdong, this research team consists of only around 20 individuals, many of whom are young researchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our visit, an ECMO internal discussion meeting was underway. Two individuals were engaged in a lively debate: one was Wang Yunbing, Director of the National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials and Medical Engineering at Sichuan University (the chief designer of the first domestic ECMO), and the other was Wang Jingyu, Deputy Chief Technician of the Cardiovascular Surgery Department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. \"We often have intense discussions, sometimes even arguing with each other,\" Wang Yunbing laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the bulky imported models, China's independently developed ECMO is remarkably compact, weighing only one-fifth of the imported devices and occupying a smaller volume, making it easily portable and capable of fitting into a 20-inch suitcase for direct air travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ECMO works by using a centrifugal pump to divert the patient's venous blood to the external circuit, where it is oxygenated through an external membrane lung before being returned to the patient's body, thus maintaining oxygen supply to the body's organs and tissues. Each step is crucial and indispensable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how did the developers achieve such a compact design while ensuring the device performs the same functions as its bulkier imported counterparts? Wang Yunbing explained that this seemingly simple domestic device incorporates key components such as a centrifugal pump, artificial vessels, a membrane lung, and a monitoring system. Through thousands of experiments, the researchers successfully integrated many functions into a single unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For example, an imported ECMO requires a separate chip 'brain' for each function. We, however, consolidated all these functions into a single chip 'brain.' This small block is actually the 'most powerful brain' that controls the entire device's operation. Doctors can easily operate the device by issuing specific commands through the screen on this small block,\" Wang Yunbing said.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance portability, the research team also shortened the length of the artificial vessels by 30% compared to imported models.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components: 'Most Powerful Brain,' Anticoagulant Coating, and Magnetic Levitation Centrifugal Pump**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Currently, through authoritative third-party assessments, the first domestic ECMO not only matches imported devices in multiple indicators but even surpasses them in some critical areas,\" Wang Yunbing stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidation of most functional chips into a single \"most powerful brain,\" presented as a small block, was a bold and surprising innovation that left industry experts in awe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one expected us to make it that small, but we did it,\" Wang Yunbing said. Initially, the research team approached the challenge with caution, first studying the critical functions required for ECMO operation and then proposing the idea of integrating these functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the working principle of ECMO, the team decided to take a bold step. Fortunately, despite its small size, the team had all the necessary expertise, including CAE Fellows, clinical doctors, medical material researchers, and chip designers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team of over 20 individuals worked tirelessly in the laboratory, conducting thousands of experiments, and finally succeeded in creating this compact \"most powerful brain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The anticoagulant coating represents a critical technological breakthrough for the domestic ECMO. After conducting thousands of experiments, the team developed an optimal anticoagulant coating that effectively reduces blood loss during external circulation, with test results showing even better performance than imported devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of the axis-free magnetic levitation centrifugal pump is another significant breakthrough. Wang Yunbing explained that the team's magnetic levitation centrifugal pump has a uniform flow distribution, causing less damage to the blood and achieving a 20% efficiency improvement over imported models.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, ECMO has been considered a \"core weapon\" in the medical device field, with numerous teams in China working on its development. Some of these teams had more resources, funding, and expertise than Wang Yunbing's group. To be honest, at the beginning, Wang Yunbing and his team were uncertain about their chances of success and felt considerable pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, they never considered giving up. \"In 2017, our team decided to develop a domestic ECMO. At that time, ECMO was still relatively unknown, but we were driven by our inner passion,\" Wang Yunbing recalled. During their visits to hospitals, they witnessed patients with severe conditions having to abandon treatment due to the high cost of ECMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those helpless and painful scenes are still fresh in Wang Yunbing's memory. \"From that moment on, I decided that we must develop a domestic ECMO, no matter how difficult it might be. It is a life-saving mission,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team's leader, CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong, provided significant support during the most challenging times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now 83 years old, CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong offered guidance throughout the process and facilitated a \"green channel\" for the ECMO development team. \"Last year, after the COVID-19 outbreak, Fellow Zhang explicitly told us to put aside all other tasks and focus solely on the ECMO development,\" Wang Yunbing said. This statement provided immense encouragement to Wang Yunbing, revealing the strong patriotic spirit of the older generation of scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its impressive capabilities, the price of this domestically produced ECMO is expected to be only one-fifth of imported models after its release. \"In the future, more patients will be able to afford ECMO, and more grassroots hospitals will have access to it,\" CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong said with anticipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Twenty Years of Scientific Accumulation: 'Med-Eng Convergence' Sparks Creativity**\n",
      "\n",
      "In CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong's view, the key to his research team's success in independently developing ECMO and reaching the clinical stage ahead of other domestic teams lies in their multidisciplinary, cross-regional collaborative team covering materials, medicine, mechanical engineering, and other complementary disciplines, as well as their long-standing experience in this field. For instance, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University has been engaged in ECMO clinical applications and related research for over 20 years. The National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials and Medical Engineering at Sichuan University, as China's first national-level research unit for biomaterials and medical devices, has been practicing the \"med-eng convergence\" model of technological development for over two decades, leading the way internationally in the field of biomaterials and medical device science and engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 1990s, CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong has led his team in tackling one international challenge after another, developing biomaterials such as dental implants and coated artificial joints that have been at the forefront of international advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong also took over as the President of the International Federation of Societies for Biomaterials and Bioengineering (FESBB), becoming the first Chinese scientist to hold this position since the federation's establishment. \"Our ECMO research team did not start from scratch but built upon more than 20 years of scientific accumulation, standing on the shoulders of giants in this field,\" Wang Yunbing said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tradition of \"industry-university-research integration\" further accelerated the development of the domestic ECMO. In the 1990s, CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong led his team in implementing \"industry-university-research integration.\" The team's company, initially registered with a capital of only 500,000 yuan, was modest in the domestic biomaterials field but achieved an annual turnover of over 10 million yuan, attracting global talent in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Yunbing was one of those attracted by this venture. He had previously served as the chief scientist at several renowned global medical device companies, developing multiple cutting-edge medical devices. However, he decided to return to the unassuming building of the National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials and Medical Engineering at Sichuan University, dedicating himself to scientific research and leading the cross-disciplinary, cross-regional team in developing China's first ECMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As researchers, we have only one goal: to do something truly meaningful and develop something beneficial to society,\" CAE Fellow Zhang Xingdong said, expressing what he believes is the core value and mission of scientific research, a sentiment shared by Wang Yunbing and the entire development team.\n",

      "Back then, there were no computers, and writing was done by hand, line by line.

      "\n",
      "One could say that the 300-word per page ruled notebook was my \"responsibility field\" back then, and this book, \"A Thousand Years, One Su Dongpo,\" was born from that field. My method was to place ten pre-allocated ruled notebooks on the left side of my desk, arrange the main reference books in front of me, read or teach during the day, and write at night. On average, I wrote six to seven pages of manuscript daily, completing roughly one book per week. In just over two months, I finished the ten notebooks (each with 50 pages) and the book. I then spent about a week modifying the manuscript on the ruled pages, submitting it three months ahead of the agreed-upon six-month deadline.\n",

      "In 1995, Taipei's Earth Village Library published the traditional Chinese version of this book. While it earned me my first bit of pocket money, the publisher changed the title to \"Biography of Su Dongpo,\" which made me unhappy. It was clearly a \"main biography,\" but they changed it to \"Biography\" to attract readers. To make up for my disappointment, Qilin arranged for 21st Century Press to publish the simplified Chinese version in 1997, earning me some RMB. The title was restored to \"A Thousand Years, One Su Dongpo.\" After the copyright expired, with my consent, China Social Sciences Press republished the simplified version in 2009, but the cover design left much to be desired. A friend posted a review on Douban Reading, saying, \"This book should be included in the 'Cover Misleads Me' series.\" Interestingly, on Douban Reading, I also found that a publisher named \"21st Century Culture and Education Co., Ltd.\" released the book in 2007 under the title \"Biography of Su Dongpo\" (without illustrations), and I'm unsure about the details.\n",

It should be smoother than the previous versions. Reading it gave me a bit of self-admiration; my skills 30 years ago weren't too bad! I also composed a small poem that encapsulates Su Dongpo's life and serves as the title for each chapter: \"From Meishan, a child prodigy emerged, whose literary fame stirred the capital. In the early stages of his career, Su the public servant became a household name. Content in the Jianghu, he struggled in the imperial court. Invited back to Jiangnan, his return was delayed.\" However, I still have some dissatisfaction with certain parts of the book. Suddenly, I recalled an advertisement from several years ago: \"Youth has no limits.\" Looking back, those were indeed \"energetic\" days. I was bold and carefree, which allowed me to write this book in just over two months. But then I thought, fortunately, I was brave and carefree back then; otherwise, how could I have written it all at once? If the author can't write it all at once, how can the reader read it all at once?\n",

      "Of course, I must thank many people for enabling me to sustain this hand-writing and work tirelessly for over two months. First, I thank my wife, who, in addition to working, silently took on almost all household chores. I was merely the shopper, visiting the market every two or three days to haggle with vendors. Second, I thank my son, whose studies from primary to high school were mostly independent of my involvement, and I feel a sense of debt towards him. I also want to thank the leaders of Jiangxi Normal University and related departments for not assigning me any administrative roles or other duties before becoming a provincial CPPCC member and library director in 1998. Even after becoming the library director and college president, the then-school secretary, Xiong Dacheng, gave me clear instructions: \"You continue to teach and conduct research as you always have; you don't need to sit in an office. The school will not place any administrative expectations on you.\" Principal Li Xianyu, while reiterating the lack of administrative requirements, said something that has stayed with me: \"If, as library director and college president, your scholarship falls behind, it is not only your personal loss but also that of Jiangxi Normal University.\"\n",

      "During my time as the library director of Jiangxi Normal University, my supervising officer, Fu Xiuyan, visited the library five times but never saw me; I was either in the book repository or at home. Instead of criticism, he offered praise: \"Managing the library effectively from home or the book repository demonstrates skill. Who says scholars can't do administration?\" This reminded me of Su Dongpo, Bai Juyi, Lu Jiuyun, Wang Yangming, and many other renowned scholars and cultural figures, all of whom brought benefits to the places they visited. At the same time, I felt a bit disheartened, reflecting on the many corrupt officials in history who harmed the people and the country, as well as the hedonistic emperors and rulers who led to the downfall of their dynasties—they were all, without exception, highly learned individuals.\n",

The Hao Stream, once severely damaged by water, was called the 'Evil Stream', but after centuries of dredging, it transformed water hazards into water resources, and its name changed from 'Evil' to 'Good'.

On a certain moonlit night, the Jinyun Mountains saw phoenixes and dragons gathering at the Dinghu Peak. The scenic spots such as the Yellow Emperor Temple, Zhutan Mountain, and the Hao Stream were misty and ethereal, filled with auspicious signs. The sound of pine winds and camphor shadows echoed like fairy music. The Miao-surname governor at that time was quite excited and immediately reported to the imperial court, saying that the gathering of phoenixes and dragons was a good omen and a rare human paradise. Thus, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty granted the name \"Xian都\" and renamed the Jinyun Mountains as the Xian都 Mountains. Since then, the name Xian都 has appeared in various historical texts and inscriptions by calligraphers on high cliffs. With the mountain named Xian都, the scenic spots also bear the same name.\n",

The history of Jinyun's sacrifice to the Yellow Emperor dates back to the Western Han Dynasty, with records in Han Guoxian's \"Dongming Ji\". The public sacrifice ceremony to the Yellow Emperor was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage in 2011.

Perhaps it is the imagination in your mind. Only the supernatural craftsmanship of nature can explain it. According to studies, the giant stone is a \"volcanic rhyolite plateau formed by the accumulation of lava\", shaped over millions of years by weathering and erosion, resulting in its remarkable height and volume, earning it the title of \"Wonder Peak of China\". From aerial photos, the top of the stone has a concave pit of hundreds of square meters, filled with grass and trees, resembling a鼎. On the stone wall, despite the erosion by wind and rain over the years, clusters of green moss can still be seen, with small trees hanging from it. Beneath the giant stone, the Lianxi, a tributary of the Hao Stream, flows broadly, occasionally mingled with mountain springs, clear and calm. A long stone bridge, 115 meters long and consisting of 75 stone piers, connects the east and west, a heritage from the Qing Dynasty, serving both as a passage and a landscape. Walking on the bridge piers, one's shoes almost touch the water, surrounded by greenery, a favorite spot for the daring. From a distance, the towering peak reaches for the sky, just as described in Wang Han's poem \"Xian都 Mountain and the Yellow Emperor Temple in Jinyun County\" from the Song Dynasty: \"In front of the temple, the fairy stone stands tall, competing for glory in the heavens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jinyun's history is imbued in these ancient artifacts—an old stream, a temple, an old tree, and a stone peak, all sources of pride. However, the scenic spots in southern Zhejiang have also been places where poets and scholars have lingered, their poems and essays recited for thousands of years. Ji Wei, a poet from the Jin Dynasty, wrote about his experiences in Jinyun in the \"Return Journey Poem\": \"Exploring the relics of Jinyun, drifting in the clear pools of a hundred miles, witnessing the solitary stones of a thousand feet.\" Tao Hongjing from the Southern and Northern Dynasties, Li Bai from the Tang Dynasty, and scholars from the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, such as Wang Shipeng, Zhu Xi, Tang Xianzu, Zhu Yizun, and Yuan Mei, have all left their marks or literary works in Jinyun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jinyun is part of the Cangkuai Mountain range, characterized by its hilly terrain, including danxia landforms, volcanic rocks, and granite. Xian都 Mountain has several secluded caves, with the largest being the Niong Cave, named by the Tang Dynasty calligrapher Li Yangbing, who was also the county magistrate at that time. The round and solid seal script in vermilion ink is particularly eye-catching on the hillside rocks. The Niong Cave is where Ji Niu, a teacher of Fan Li during the Spring and Autumn Period, took refuge and taught while hiding in southern Zhejiang, changing his name to avoid detection. Later, in memory of Ji Niu, the cave was named Niong Cave. Inside, there are inscriptions praising his conduct. Li Yangbing, the uncle of Li Bai, was fond of collecting cliff inscriptions during his tenure as county magistrate. His expertise in seal script resulted in valuable inscriptions like the \"Yellow Emperor Temple\" stele. According to statistics, the earliest carvings in Jinyun date back to the Tang Dynasty, with the most numerous ones from the Song Dynasty. Among the poems and essays about Jinyun, the earliest record of its scenic beauty and historical significance was written by Xie Lingyun, a field poet from the Southern and Northern Dynasties. Xu Ning, a Tang Dynasty poet, wrote in one of his two poems titled \"Inscription on Jinyun Mountain and Dingchi\": \"The banners of the Yellow Emperor have long gone, leaving only the verdant cliffs. Sometimes the wind stirs up the waves of Dinghu Lake, scattering them like raindrops in the clear sky.\" This poem is widely circulated in the local area. Yuan Mei, during his journey from Yongjia to Jinyun in the Qing Dynasty, wrote the \"Record of Traveling to Xian都 Peak\", recounting the near miss with the Xian都 scenery, which became a popular story at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the Niong Cave is the Unique Peak Academy, facing the Hao Stream and leaning against the Good Mountain. The small courtyard with winding paths leading to seclusion is covered in green moss. This was once the teaching place of Zhu Xi. In the ninth year of Chunxi in the Song Dynasty, he traveled from Jiangxi to the southeast, then further to Fujian for teaching and making friends. After lingering in several places, he finally settled at the foot of Good Mountain beside the Hao Stream, attracted by the scholarly atmosphere. He established a school, made friends, and taught here, saying, \"Here is the best place for study and cultivation.\" He also humorously wrote, \"Unsaddling my horse, I forgot to return, the green bamboo in the clear valley resembles my old mountain.\" Years later, Chen brothers and others set up a memorial hall at the teaching site to commemorate their teacher. In the first year of Shaoding in the Southern Song Dynasty, it was rebuilt as the Unique Peak Academy. The recent renovation is a more recent event. When we visited, the fine rain and the secluded courtyard were almost deserted, with only the sound of pine waves and water. Perhaps this quiet place, far from the hustle and bustle, in harmony with nature's melody, is the essence of studying and learning. Academic pursuits and scholarly achievements are, after all, the solitary cultivation of philosophers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the southern Zhejiang region of Lishui, there are many well-preserved ancient villages with unique styles, serving as models for the most beautiful ancient villages on a large scale. Among the numerous historical sites, the thousand-year-old Heyang Folk Dwelling in Jinyun is like a giant living fossil, sparkling with glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most spectacular feature is the undulating and magnificent horse-head walls. The horse-head wall group along the Daoist Priest Road in Heyang Village is the pinnacle of the grand art group sculpture of ancient architecture. Built during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the connected buildings along the street form thirty-two unique \"horse-head\" structures on the wall, extending over 90 meters, each with a different expression. The black and white colors create a sense of bright, simple, and layered beauty. From a distance, they resemble thirty-two steeds galloping and flying together, moving forward relentlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heyang Village is predominantly inhabited by the Zhu surname, with a long tradition of valuing education and literature. The naming of the village and its gatehouses reflects this, such as the \"Eight Scholars Gate\", built to commemorate the eight scholars who passed the imperial examination during the Song and Yuan dynasties. The emphasis on ethics and education is also reflected in the naming of alleys and ancestral halls, such as \"Between Generosity and Modesty,\" \"Public Field Office,\" \"Public Benefit Bridge,\" and \"Following Rules.\" The village has produced eight imperial scholars and twenty-four poets, forming the influential \"Yiyang Poetry School\", with an eight-volume poetry collection, a significant contribution to the modern literature of southern Zhejiang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking through the thousand-year-old village, the aged bluestone roads, rustic stone and brick carvings, and courtyard houses evoke the aroma of history, allowing one to sense the mists of bygone days, what is often referred to as homesickness. Yet, within this ancient village, both leisurely and busy lifestyles coexist. Outside the village, in front of many homes, vibrant flowers in various colorful pots adorn the turning blue doorstones, especially one type without a name, resembling lanterns with yellow and red stripes, bright and dazzling, the size of eggs. Against the backdrop of blue tiles and white walls, they are exceptionally vivid.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the launch ceremony, 20 students from Zhengzhou University's School of Physical Education who will participate in the \"Public Welfare Sports Lottery Happy Playground\" sports education and teaching activities took an on-site oath. In the coming summer, Zhengzhou University's School of Physical Education will actively prepare course design and training for teaching volunteers. This fall, these 20 teaching volunteers will each head to 10 \"Public Welfare Sports Lottery Happy Playground\" recipient schools to provide in-depth sports education and teaching services.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that the \"Public Welfare Sports Lottery Happy Playground\" is a public welfare activity that benefits society. The activity delivers sports equipment suitable for physical education teaching and professional physical education classes to primary schools in rural areas. The Henan Sports Lottery Administration Center has been conducting the \"Public Welfare Sports Lottery Happy Playground\" activity for 10 consecutive years since 2013, and in 2021, it joined hands with Henan Normal University for the first time to introduce sports education and teaching content to the activity, providing sports education and teaching services to 10 recipient primary schools. The initiative was well-received by the faculty and students of the recipient schools and won widespread acclaim from all sectors of society, achieving excellent social outcomes. This year's \"Public Welfare Sports Lottery Happy Playground\" activity attracted a record high of 1037 schools registering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Haixin, director of the Henan Sports Lottery Administration Center, introduced that last year's sports education and teaching activity exceeded expectations and became one of the highlight moments of the 10-year activity. The diverse sports equipment met the needs of rural schools for physical education teaching, and professional sports teachers helped schools build professional sports teaching systems, bringing professional sports classes and sports teaching knowledge to the children. With the help of the teaching teachers, some rural primary schools held their first full-school sports meet since their establishment. A child from a recipient primary school in Luoshan County, Xinyang City, said, \"It was you who taught us sports knowledge and how to treat injuries after exercising. Your humor made the classroom lively and rich, and it also made me fall in love with sports. Thank you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The children's liking and recognition are also one of the reasons we continue to carry out sports education and teaching activities this year,\" said Wang Haixin.

      "\n",
      "The statement said that based on the previous generation model Evo 1, Evo 2 has evolved into the largest AI model in the field of biology to date. The model is trained on 930 billion nucleotides based on more than 128,000 genomic data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The developers pointed out that the development of the Evo 1 and Evo 2 models represents a crucial moment in the emerging field of generative biology, as these models enable machines to \"read, write, and think in the language of nucleotides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that Evo 2 can be used for multiple tasks. It can identify gene variations that affect protein function and organism adaptability. For example, in tests on variants of the BRCA1 gene related to breast cancer, Evo 2 achieved an accuracy rate of over 90% in predicting which mutations are benign and which are potentially pathogenic. This will save a large amount of time and research funds used in cell or animal experiments, and accelerate the development of new drugs by identifying the genetic causes of human diseases. In addition, Evo 2 can also be used to design new biological tools or therapeutic methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement also emphasized that considering potential ethical and safety risks, the researchers excluded pathogens that infect humans and other complex organisms from the underlying dataset of Evo 2, and ensured that the model would not return valid answers to related queries about these pathogens.\n",

Statistics show that by 2024, the village achieved a production value of 30 billion yuan, clustering over 1,200 galleries and related businesses, employing over 20,000 people in the surrounding areas and industries, and forming a complete oil painting industry chain encompassing creation, production, sales, trading, and ancillary services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transforming from a once-obscure Hakka village to a global oil painting industry landmark, Dafen Oil Painting Village's evolution is not merely the legend woven by a single brush and painting but has become a model for traditional villages undergoing transformation and upgrading into cultural industry hotspots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proactive Transformation and Innovation\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1980s, Dafen Oil Painting Village was known as Dafen Village, a predominantly agricultural community with around 300 residents, focusing on rice cultivation. In 1989, Hong Kong art dealer Huang Jiang recognized the area's low labor costs and proximity to Hong Kong, leading his apprentices to establish a bulk oil painting replication and copying business, selling the paintings overseas and laying the foundation for Dafen's oil painting industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This oil painting manufacturing model quickly created a cluster effect, attracting painters and art dealers from across the country to engage in oil painting production and sales,\" introduced Zhang Ke, Deputy Director of Dafen Oil Painting Village Cultural Development Center and Deputy Curator of Dafen Art Museum. \"Dafen Village gradually gained international recognition for its oil painting production and became known as the 'Oil Painting Village.' At that time, many world-famous paintings were sold abroad as replicas from Dafen Oil Painting Village, with a vast market reach. Particularly in 2004, after becoming the sole branch venue of the inaugural China (Shenzhen) International Cultural Industry Fair, orders flooded in.\" At its peak, 70% of the world's oil paintings originated from China, with 80% of those coming from Dafen Oil Painting Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the industry's rise was not without challenges. In 2008, the global financial crisis led to a significant drop in export orders, posing a severe test for the village's painters and art dealers. To tackle this crisis, Dafen Oil Painting Village, while deepening its oil painting industrialization, attempted a transition towards original painting, with the creation of original works on the rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amidst this crisis, Dafen Oil Painting Village discovered new possibilities,\" Zhang Ke stated. \"The government actively guided the transformation and upgrading of Dafen's oil painting industry, supporting original artists, developing products with independent intellectual property rights, and introducing or establishing leading enterprises.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dafen Art Museum plays a crucial role in nurturing original artists within the village. Since its establishment in 2007, it has hosted approximately 1,000 exhibitions and events, launching branded projects such as the Shenzhen Dafen International Oil Painting Biennale, National (Dafen) Young and Middle-aged Oil Painting Exhibition, and Dafen Indigenous Artist Promotion Project. The museum has also collaborated with professional institutions like the China Artists Association to organize distinctive events such as the China Art Academy Students' Oil Painting Exhibition and the Chinese Contemporary Female Painters' Oil Painting Exhibition, providing a high-level exchange platform for domestic and international original artists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xu Bingtun, a local original painter in Dafen Oil Painting Village, benefited from this support. In 2021, with the backing of the Dafen Indigenous Artist Promotion Project, his oil painting solo exhibition, \"Beyond the Elephant,\" was held at the Dafen Art Museum. \"This exhibition presented and summarized my years of artistic achievements,\" expressed Xu Bingtun. The solo exhibition increased the visibility of his work and provided an opportunity for face-to-face communication with audiences and professionals, gathering diverse perspectives and suggestions to inspire his future creations. Various art events organized by Dafen Oil Painting Village also broadened his creative horizons, facilitating his continuous progress in original art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dafen Oil Painting Village's support for original talents extends further. In 2013, the village, in collaboration with the Shenzhen Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, organized the Shenzhen Painting Vocational Skills Competition, which has been held for 12 consecutive years. Through a points-based reward system, approximately 200 talents have been attracted, with 22 receiving the title of Shenzhen Technical Expert. The village has also developed 268 painter apartments with a total construction area of 27,600 square meters, providing housing services for outstanding art workers in the zone and surrounding communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this impetus, the village's original artistic forces have shown a rapid development trend, boasting over 400 domestic and international professional painters, including 50 members of the China Artists Association, 92 provincial-level members of the Guangdong Artists Association, and 265 municipal-level members of the Shenzhen Artists Association. In the last five years, 200 original works by Dafen Oil Painting Village artists have been selected for national and provincial art exhibitions, providing solid talent support for Shenzhen's cultural development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversifying Market Structures\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The foundation of Dafen Oil Painting Village's development lies in the market,\" Zhang Ke emphasized. Today, the village is actively expanding into new market sectors like art experiences, art study tours, and cultural tourism. These new sectors, complementing the traditional ones, offer Dafen Oil Painting Village more opportunities to be recognized and establish itself as a vital force driving local economic and cultural prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emergence of these new sectors is attributed to the exploration and practice of pioneers like Zeng Guifu, General Manager of Shenzhen Renyi Cultural Communication Co., Ltd. As the first to introduce experiential consumption in Dafen Oil Painting Village, Zeng Guifu, as early as 2013, recognized the trend of consumption upgrading and innovatively transformed painting art into a consumable and shareable experience for the masses, achieving a dual victory in commercial value and social value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we first started this project, many peers were skeptical, and consumers were full of doubts,\" recalled Zeng Guifu. \"Everyone was accustomed to free trial classes in training schools, expecting experiences to be free. However, the underlying logic of training schools and experiential projects is different. Traditional training schools often start with teaching students to copy, using 'how well it resembles the original' as a selling point to attract parents to enroll their children. While this method can quickly demonstrate learning outcomes, it rarely fosters a genuine love for art. In contrast, experiential projects engage people in a casual and enjoyable manner, sparking interest in painting and encouraging them to pursue professional learning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Coinciding with the rise of social media sharing, many clients would take photos of their paintings and share them on their social circles, inadvertently promoting Zeng Guifu's project. \"This word-of-mouth marketing significantly boosted the project's visibility, drawing attention and imitation from numerous tourists and peers, accelerating the spread and development of experiential consumption in Dafen Oil Painting Village,\" Zeng Guifu added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Dafen Oil Painting Village is filled with cafes, painting studios, and galleries, transforming into a novel urban public space and a \"Culture+\" characteristic cultural street that integrates exhibitions, art education, and leisure. As experiential economics and the integration of culture and tourism flourish, the village also embraces the wave of digital transformation, continually injecting new vitality. Artists actively adopt digitalization, combining traditional art with short video platforms to open up new online marketing channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fantastical 3D murals adorning the village's walls, featuring fierce tigers breaking through the barriers and girls sitting on stools within arm's reach, are the creations of Zhang Xiaoyuan, a street 3D painter. Zhang Xiaoyuan introduced that he has amassed nearly 2 million followers and over 10 million likes on short video platforms, receiving numerous commercial invitations. He has also collaborated with multiple cultural and creative parks to take 3D painting from the streets to broader commercial stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Ke indicated that Dafen Oil Painting Village will continue to deepen its \"Culture+\" industrial ecosystem, not only contributing to Shenzhen's construction as an international art hub but also creating a replicable and promotable cultural industry upgrade model to offer experiences for similar industries nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadening International Horizons\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of development, Dafen Oil Painting Village's oil painting industry continues to upgrade. Through creating digital art works, developing art derivatives, and leveraging artificial intelligence, the village is establishing new growth points and further transforming from a \"World Oil Painting Factory\" into an \"International Art Center.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technologies provide fresh impetus for industrial upgrading. \"This 70cm x 72cm oil painting can be produced by the machine in just 15 minutes, with a texture indistinguishable from handmade paintings,\" explained Zhou Qi, co-founder of Shenzhen Yajin Cultural Group Co., Ltd., holding an AI-produced oil painting. The \"AI Smart Painting Machine\" developed by the Yajin Group over two years offers a 3D digital solution for texture oil paintings, providing customized designs for clients applicable to various materials like ceramics, carpets, and glass. With a simple input command, the machine can draw from its vast database to create fused works of art. Matching the quality and effects of overseas counterparts, the machine's price is only a third of theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously building bridges for exchange and cooperation, the Yajin Group also empowers the internationalization of Dafen Oil Painting Village's oil painting industry. The group has integrated global art resources, signing over 500 contemporary artists from home and abroad, digitizing their works and incorporating them into the group's database. They have also established an online customization platform, driving product exports to Europe, America, and other regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long Jingchuang, founder of T5 Contemporary Art Center and President of Dafen Fine Art Industry Association, is another significant driver of Dafen Oil Painting Village's oil painting industry internationalization. \"I have been rooted in Dafen Oil Painting Village since 2003, witnessing its transformation and growth,\" recalled Long Jingchuang. During his initial decade in the village, he focused on creating decorative paintings, primarily sold to hotels in Europe and America. As market demands shifted, people began pursuing fashionable and personalized art trends. He swiftly adapted, transforming his studio into a gallery and establishing an international, branded, and professional operating structure. He signed a team of over 50 artists, primarily consisting of Dafen indigenous artists, and vigorously promoted original art trend works on an international scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Currently, China's art market still holds immense potential,\" Long Jingchuang stated. \"With improving living standards, the demand for art consumption is increasing, and more people seek to enrich their spiritual lives through art. Based on the mature industrial chain already established in Dafen Oil Painting Village, we will continuously enhance originality, actively introduce young artists, broaden international perspectives, and drive Dafen Oil Painting Village to conquer larger markets at home and abroad. The association currently has over 800 member units, and we are collectively striving for the oil painting industry in Dafen Oil Painting Village to reach new heights.\" Long Jingchuang expressed his confidence in the future of Dafen Oil Painting Village's oil painting industry.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this performance, Liu Jing, the president of the Ningxia Performing Arts Group's Peking Opera Troupe, once again collaborated with Lan Tian, an outstanding leading man from the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe. With their exquisite skills and passionate dedication, they delivered an extraordinary performance for the Shanghai audience. The modern Peking Opera \"Red Sorghum\" is adapted from the eponymous novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Mo Yan, depicting the touching stories of Jiu'er, Shabao, and others who dared to love and fight during the 1930s and 1940s. Through the traditional art form of Peking Opera, the play vividly showcases the life attitudes and free spirits of the ancestors during that historical period.\n",

It blazes a new trail for Peking Opera performances. It is understood that the newly compiled modern Peking Opera \"Red Sorghum\" has already received widespread acclaim in previous performances and has been successfully selected for several important art festival lineups. This performance not only offered Shanghai audiences a fresh artistic experience but will further promote the play's dissemination and popularity across the nation.\n",

      "The construction of ideological and political theory courses is the main channel for students' ideological and political education. General Secretary Xi Jinping has made important instructions on the construction of school ideological and political courses, emphasizing that \"we should uphold correctness and innovate, promote the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses, and continuously improve their targetedness and attractiveness.\" This important discourse has charted the course for promoting the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses in the new era and doing well in ideological and political education. To promote the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses and enhance comprehensive education effects, we must insist on a problem-oriented approach, a systemic viewpoint, and the integration of traditional advantages with information technology to continuously solve pain points and blockages, creating a new situation in ideological and political education in the new era, enabling ideological and political courses to better fulfill the fundamental task of fostering morality and cultivating talents, and striving to nurture more individuals who are reliable to the Party, patriotic, and capable of shouldering the heavy responsibilities of national rejuvenation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhering to a problem-oriented approach, accurately resolving prominent contradictions\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhering to a problem-oriented approach is an important component of the world view and methodology of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era. General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that \"we must have a strong sense of problem awareness, orient ourselves towards major problems, and further study and think about key issues, making efforts to solve the various prominent contradictions and problems facing China's development.\" This provides methodological guidance for promoting the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses. Ideological and political courses are key to fulfilling the fundamental task of fostering morality and cultivating talents. In promoting the intrinsic development of these courses, we must enhance our sense of problem awareness, aim at problems and make corrections accordingly, ensuring precise efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has regarded the construction of ideological and political courses as a top priority in the Party's leadership of educational work, and the overall environment and ecosystem for the development of ideological and political courses have undergone a fundamental change. However, we must recognize that the construction of ideological and political courses still faces new situations and tasks. With the profound and complex changes in the domestic and international environment, the depth of ideological and political work is constantly increasing, and its scope is gradually expanding, making the task more challenging. Some regions and schools still lack sufficient attention to the construction of ideological and political courses; they have weak awareness and capabilities in opening up ideological and political courses and mobilizing various social resources, and there are issues like \"forced integration\" and \"superficiality\" in the integration of ideological and political education into professional courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the issue of insufficient attention to ideological and political courses, Party committees (Party working committees) at all levels should genuinely enhance their political stance and ideological awareness, placing the construction of ideological and political courses on important agendas. Various schools should consciously assume their primary responsibility, deeply practice the \"eight unifications,\" and play the roles of the \"main force\" of the teacher teams, the \"main battlefield\" of course construction, and the \"main channel\" of classroom teaching. They should innovatively and optimize the discipline system, teaching system, discourse system, and practice system in a targeted manner. To address the issue of \"forced integration\" in the integration of ideological and political education into professional courses, we must focus on the fundamental question of \"what kind of people to cultivate, how to cultivate them, and for whom to cultivate them.\" Guided by Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, we should utilize and optimize various resources to build a course system, promote the coordinated development of ideological and political courses and the integration of ideological and political education into professional courses, and continuously drive the renewal of ideological and political course concepts, broaden their horizons, and expand their scope by resolving various contradictions in ideological and political course construction.\n",

Promoting the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses is a complex systemic project that requires overall planning with a systemic viewpoint, following the laws of ideological and political course education and student growth. It involves integrating multiple resources, coordinating various elements, and making efforts to integrate ideological and political work into the talent cultivation system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coordinately promote the integrated construction of ideological and political courses in primary, secondary, and higher education. It is very necessary to progressively and spirally offer ideological and political theory courses in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions, which is an important guarantee for cultivating a new generation of socialist builders and successors. In deeply promoting the integrated construction of ideological and political education in primary, secondary, and higher education, we must adhere to systemic thinking, adopt systemic methods, and establish a scientific system. We should integrate ideological and political education across primary, secondary, and higher education, covering the entire talent cultivation cycle, and form a course system in which different segments and various ideological and political courses are both independent and mutually supportive. We should build a shared platform for integrated construction resources, achieve the sharing of high-quality educational resources, and promote positive interactions between different nurturing subjects in primary, secondary, and higher education. We should strive to set educational goals according to students' physical and mental development characteristics and local and school realities, ensuring smooth connections.\n",

We should perfect the course system and solve the problem of cooperation between various courses and ideological and political courses. On the horizontal level, we should promote the coordinated development of ideological and political courses and the integration of ideological and political education into professional courses, expand educational channels, and achieve an organic combination of explicit education in ideological and political courses and implicit education in the integration of ideological and political education into professional courses. We should resolve the issue of the \"two unconnected aspects\" between ideological and political courses and professional courses, achieving an organic combination of morality cultivation and talent cultivation, education and nurturing, helping students grow and succeed, and expanding the paths and methods of education. At the same time, we should integrate ideological and political classrooms into the larger society.

We should use new media and technology to bring our work to life, integrating the traditional advantages of ideological and political work with information technology to enhance their sense of the times and attractiveness. Currently, information technology provides new opportunities for the intrinsic development of ideological and political courses. We should utilize digital technology and artificial intelligence to empower the construction of \"big ideological and political courses,\" focusing on content support and strength. We should drive content optimization and teaching method innovation, introduce new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality into ideological and political course teaching, and achieve a full integration and mutual promotion between digital technology and \"big ideological and political courses,\" nurturing new energy, opening up new paths, and shaping new patterns for ideological and political education in schools in the new era.\n",

We should make efforts to enhance the attractiveness and usage rate of smart education platforms, promoting the sharing of \"big ideological and political course\" resources. Utilizing modern information technology, we should deliver a combination punch of \"online plus offline\" education, connecting in-school and out-of-school, online and offline, and achieving real-time interactions between teachers and students and between students.

      "[According to Ta Kung Pao] With the market awaiting the results of the Fed's interest rate meeting and the thickening holiday atmosphere towards the end of the year, some impatient homeowners have expanded their negotiating space. Yesterday, the second-hand market again recorded 10 cases of losses, including a property in University Hill, Tai Po, where the owner held the property for a year and a half and left with a loss of over one million dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Christmas approaches and the holiday mood intensifies, the volume of second-hand transactions continues to decline. Yesterday, loss-making transactions dominated the market, with University Hill being one of the most notable cases. Chen Yun'er, Chief District Sales Manager of Centaline Property, said that a two-bedroom unit in Block 2, Middle Floor, A1 room of the estate, with a usable area of 404 square feet, was purchased by a family customer for 5.998 million dollars, at a usable price of 14,847 dollars per square foot. According to the data, the original owner purchased it for over 7.09 million dollars in June 2023, holding it for only about a year and a half, resulting in a loss of over 1.092 million dollars and a depreciation of 15.4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Tuen Mun, a loss-making property was snapped up by a tenant. Lee Tak-hung, Senior Manager of Sunlight Real Estate, said that a high-floor C room in Block 3 of Fulname Mountain Fulcourt, with a usable area of 422 square feet, was purchased by an investor with a rental agreement for 4.05 million dollars, at a usable price of 9,597 dollars per square foot. The original owner, a one-hand homeowner, purchased it for 4.96 million dollars in 2015 and has been renting out the property. The current sale results in a loss of 910,000 dollars or 18.3%.\n",

      "One apple tempted Eve, leading humanity out of ignorance and into culture; one apple fell on Newton, inspiring the discovery of the law of universal gravitation and driving scientific progress; and one apple, with a bite taken out of it by Steve Jobs, gave birth to the \"Apple\" brand, showcasing the power of culture and technology fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this statement is made in jest, it vividly illustrates that the fusion of culture and technology has extensively permeated our lives and profoundly transformed our world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3D movie *Avatar* is a prime example. Its script was written over a decade ago, but due to technological limitations at the time, the film's production was delayed. Director James Cameron and his team spent years solely focused on developing the necessary technology, eventually creating their own 3D cameras and other high-tech innovations. Only after this technological upgrade did they begin filming *Avatar*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subsequent success of the film demonstrated the allure of the marriage between technology and creative culture. *Avatar* became a global phenomenon, not only making Cameron a household name but more importantly, showcasing the power of technology and culture combined. For the cultural industry, especially the creative cultural industry, integrating high-tech advancements has become an essential choice for sustained growth. Without the support of technology, many cultural creations may remain as mere illusions, struggling to become scalable, market-ready cultural products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, some high-end cultural forms are directly driven by technology, such as animation, online games, and digital publishing. These emerging sectors, which have gained popularity in recent years, have gradually become integral parts of the cultural industry, representing its core competitiveness. It is technology that has fueled the rise of these sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, if technology is not infused with cultural content, the product, no matter how flawless, remains a mechanical \"shell.\" Apple's product line is successful because it infuses its items with unique cultural significance, turning them into symbols. Without delivering this cultural experience to consumers, Apple would be just another phone or computer manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the rapid development of China's cultural industry has opened up immense opportunities, attracting numerous tech-oriented businesses to engage in cultural production. Notable achievements have been made in areas like digital product manufacturing and production equipment. However, overall, traditional cultural and technological integration has seen culture passively accepting technology. The fusion of culture and technology should be more diverse, encompassing both the advancement of culture through foundational technology and the promotion of technological research and development by cultural creativity. As the methods and paths for combining cultural creativity and technological outcomes become increasingly abundant, and the space for cultural and technological fusion expands, culture must transform from a passive to an active role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the cultural industry has gradually become a crucial pivot for adjusting China's economic structure and an essential focus for transforming its economic development model. With the continuous improvement of material living standards, the spiritual and cultural needs of the Chinese people are becoming increasingly diversified, multi-tiered, and multifaceted, urgently requiring cultural products to innovate in content, form, dissemination methods, and service models. Only by accelerating the research and development and transformation of cultural and technological innovations, producing more expressive and attractive cultural products, and providing higher-quality cultural services, can we better satisfy the spiritual and cultural demands of the people and enhance the core competitiveness of the cultural industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, currently, the creativity, expressiveness, dissemination power, competitiveness, and influence of cultural products await further enhancement through technological leadership and support. The National Cultural and Technological Innovation Project, officially launched in May of this year, further clarified that promoting the tight fusion of technology and culture is a vital direction for the development of the cultural industry. To drive the transformation of the cultural industry's development model and achieve the goal of making it a pillar industry of the national economy by the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan, top-level design, standard setting, and other tasks in the cultural and technological field are also urgent priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fusion of culture and technology requires talent above all, but the shortage of talent is currently a significant bottleneck in the development of the cultural industry. Simultaneously, funding and developmental environment pressures also constrain the further integration of culture and technology. Historically, high-tech innovations have been associated with high costs, deterring many businesses and leading to low-level competition within the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve a tighter fusion of culture and technology, innovative developmental thinking is essential. Limited resources must be prioritized for investment in specific areas of cultural and technological fusion. How can we make the integration of culture and technology more efficient? Today's cultural producers must not only learn to utilize technological advancements but also make the most economical choices.\n",

      "Based on the first secretaries' commitments, the city clarifies the responsibilities of three parties: the Organization Department as the leading unit, the dispatching unit as the responsible unit, and the township (street) as the supervising body. It actively promotes the integration of responsibilities, projects, funds, and personnel, fostering a good situation where \"one person is stationed in the village, and the whole team provides support.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A commitment is not only a goal direction but also a responsibility. Panzhou's first secretaries, deeply engaging with the masses, listen to and serve the people. They prioritize the urgent needs of the villagers, addressing a series of prominent issues that affect and restrict rural development and are strongly reflected by the public. So far, the first secretaries in Panzhou have led their work teams to solve 80 prominent problems in the aspect of people's livelihoods and have done 900 good deeds for the public. They have also conducted 110,000 visits to left-behind children, the elderly, and people in difficult circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fang Jun, the first secretary in Tangziyan Village, Jichangping Town, utilized the medical resources of the dispatching unit and made a commitment to provide \"four services\" to the people: organizing medical experts to visit and treat patients, providing medicine delivery, assisting in processing chronic disease cards, and establishing an online platform for expert-public interaction. Since 2023, he has organized six medical experts to visit and treat patients, helped 41 elderly people with limited mobility to get their medicine, assisted over 200 people in processing chronic disease cards, and built one online expert-public interaction platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rural work is complex and multifaceted. Grasping the construction of the grassroots organization is like grasping the \"bull's nose.\" Lu Shikon, the first secretary in Jiuyingju Community, sincerely fulfilled his commitment of \"strengthening the village and enriching the people.\" He established a linked working mode of \"resident officers + community officers + community party members\" and organized 30 party members and community officers to actively participate in consolidating and expanding the achievements of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expanding and strengthening village collective economy is the \"booster\" for comprehensively pushing forward rural revitalization. Yan Bin, the first secretary in Xiaoshulin Community, Pingdi Township, made use of the tourism resource advantages of the Wumeng Grand Grassland, accurately identifying the development position of \"tourism +.\" He actively sought support from the dispatching unit, raising and collecting 12 million yuan in funds. He launched projects such as strawberry gardens, grape gardens, vegetable gardens, and characteristic homestays to assist Xiaoshulin Community's rural revitalization. The accumulation of village collective economy increased from over 1.5 million yuan to over 5.7 million yuan.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the founding of the People's Republic of China, Academician Zhu Futang, founder of Beijing Children's Hospital, proposed the hospital's motto: \"Public-spiritedness, Kindness, Diligence, and Harmony.\" Generation after generation of pediatricians have upheld these four principles, saving lives, healing the wounded, and safeguarding children's health. This spirit is a vital source for Beijing Children's Hospital to integrate core values into work and life. On the 7th, the 89th session of the \"Core Values Hundred Lectures\" series entered Beijing Children's Hospital. Dr. Ni Xin, President of the hospital, expressed that this event not only fully affirms the hospital's efforts in nurturing and practicing core values but also sets higher requirements for inheriting and promoting the motto \"Public-spiritedness, Kindness, Diligence, and Harmony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dr. Ni, under the care and leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee, the Municipal Health Commission, and the Municipal Medical Administration Bureau, the hospital has actively nurtured and practiced socialist core values, emphasizing the guiding role of hospital culture. This has led to the emergence of role models such as Dr. Jia Liqun, Director of the Ultrasound Department, who has diagnosed over 70,000 pediatric patients with complex diseases and saved more than 2,000 critically ill children. Dr. Qian Suyun, Director of the Critical Care Medicine Department, has participated in the rescue of critically ill children during public health emergencies across the country over 10 times, conducted pioneering research on cerebral blood flow monitoring in critically ill children, and proposed a pediatric brain death diagnosis standard using transcranial Doppler, filling a void in domestic pediatric medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Beijing Children's Hospital Party Committee has earnestly implemented the spirit of the National Health and Health Conference, managing three maternal and child hospitals in Shunyi, Baoding, and Zhengzhou, and promoting a \"patient-immobile, doctor-mobile\" treatment model to share expert resources and benefit local patients. The hospital has also comprehensively implemented the modern hospital management system, continuously driving the development of pediatrics and winning numerous honors, including the title of National Civilized Unit, Advanced Grassroots Party Organization in the National Create Excellence Competition, and Outstanding Unit for Ideological and Political Work in Beijing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Ni indicated that Beijing Children's Hospital will take this event as an opportunity, striving to focus on \"entering minds, hearts, and actions,\" and exerting effort in \"fine details, small steps, and practical implementation.\" The hospital aims to internalize socialist core values genuinely and externalize them in actions, putting them into practice. Leveraging the hospital's reform, development, and the construction of the National Children's Medical Center, the hospital will lead China's pediatric medical field to new heights.\n",

      "Confusion varies at every stage. Recently, I've met several peers, and after hearing their concerns, I realize my own can only be considered trivial complaints. At most, they stem from the challenge of managing multiple projects, leading to a lack of focus and reduced business efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, I've been pondering over subsequent investment and the allocation of energy in real business. It's clear that I should persist in doing well in real business; there's indeed not much to do as a full-time investor. Away from real business, many information advantages cease to exist. For instance, having done e-commerce, one becomes very familiar with platform changes—be it Pinduoduo's short videos or Taobao's increased commissions. Team work reports or peer exchanges all provide information crucial for investment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engaging in the liquor business means daily interactions with numerous suppliers, ensuring timely access to market information. Even occasional market timing has a high success rate. The confusion here boils down to management issues. If you don't follow up with the team periodically, it's easy to become lax. Once that happens, tightening the reins becomes an uphill task. Business owners themselves can get complacent, let alone the team. Moreover, business operations are interconnected; a problem in one link can trigger a series of issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last two years, I haven't managed the supply chain much, and the team's sense of rhythm has clearly weakened. Each person's genes determine their strengths, and my role remains crucial. The American startup plan has been steadily advancing, but it's still constrained by energy allocation. Simply providing product supply chain and business operation philosophy output doesn't support business expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it's not losing money yet, without end-to-end involvement, slightly increased investment could return us to the 2021 state. If we handle everything from start to finish, there won't be any issues, but it will consume unlimited energy. Pure investment now has a very stable profit. After two years of testing, integrating startup thinking into the investment system can fully support short, medium, and long-term strategies. A-shares, US stocks, and HK stocks, through two years of intensive training, leverage my strengths in identifying undervalued stocks and valuation systems for stable profits without emotional fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of entrepreneurship are still immense. Low-cost trial and error, and the ability to view issues from multiple angles, make it more precise than pure investment. So, I must maintain industry chain communication. Currently, I need to improve team communication and feedback, especially considering the characteristics of the northern team. Repeatedly refining work content and standards is necessary. External changes require constant emphasis. The team can handle internal business and execution well, but communication at the management or business level, along with resource allocation, still needs a partner.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the agreement, the two parties will fully leverage their respective strengths, establish a close and stable strategic cooperative relationship, and deepen cooperation in areas such as the establishment of scenic spot-themed post offices, cultural and tourism brand promotion, major event hosting, and support for rural revitalization. This aims to continuously improve the ability and level of Hubei Post's service to the local cultural and tourism industry. Together, they will work to capitalize on Hubei's rich cultural and tourism resources and geographical advantages to jointly strive for a strong cultural and tourism province, making new contributions to the accelerated construction of a pilot zone for a new development pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since February this year, the Hubei Branch has actively docked and prepared with the provincial Department of Culture and Tourism for the signing of the strategic cooperation agreement. It has also fully participated in and served a series of activities hosted by the provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, such as the Most Beautiful Flower Season in Hubei, the \"Know-Sound Hubei Cultural and Tourism Recommender\" selection, and the Summer Cultural and Tourism Season in Hubei, laying a solid foundation for communication and cooperation between the two parties. Since the launch of the 2024 \"Know-Sound Hubei Meets Golden Autumn\" Hubei Cultural and Tourism Consumption Season by the Hubei Department of Culture and Tourism on September 29th, postal branches across the province have actively cooperated with the cultural and tourism promotion of Hubei in the fall. They have seized opportunities such as the National Day tourism peak season and the Wudang Tai Chi Conference to set up temporary post offices at major attractions and event sites, offering on-site services. They have also opened a dedicated small program zone for \"Know-Sound Hubei Meets Golden Autumn\" postcards, providing sales of Hubei tourist landmark postcards, stamp collection and card-swiping services, as well as personalized DIY experiences for colored postcards, which have been widely welcomed by tourists and citizens. This has comprehensively enhanced the brand influence of Hubei Post.\n",

Recently, the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission publicly notified ten typical cases of formalism and bureaucracy that added to the burden on the grassroots level.\n",

      "2. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Benxi City, Liaoning Province, formulated documents that were out of touch with reality and added layers of complexity.\n",
      "3. The Health Insurance Bureau of Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province, simplified the methods for increasing the electronic health insurance voucher settlement rate, leading to medical institutions falsely increasing outpatient departments and fake transactions.\n",

      "6. The Municipal Public Utilities Maintenance Service Center in Chenzhou City, Hunan Province, engaged in inaction, slow action, and misconduct in public services.\n",
      "7. The Planning and Natural Resources Bureau of Shuangliu District, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, simplified the approach to rectifying illegal land use, and the Yi Xin Street Office engaged in formalism during the rectification process.\n",
      "8. The Agricultural Ecology and Environmental Resources Protection Station in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, engaged in excessive record-keeping.\n",
      "9. The Administrative Service Bureau of Yongshan County, Yunnan Province, set unrealistic task indicators during the promotion and application of the \"One-Stop Service on a Mobile Phone\" platform.\n",

They should resolutely correct the problem of formalism and bureaucracy that adds to the burden on the grassroots level. Grassroots-level disciplinary and supervisory organs should keep a close eye on old problems and new situations that add to the burden on the grassroots level, strengthen supervision, discipline, and accountability, remind and correct early signs of problems, and severely deal with disciplinary and illegal acts.

      "We should bear in mind that the decline of neoliberal globalization, so-called capitalist in nature, was already underway before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a crisis. It has become increasingly clear that relying solely on an international relations system based on a unipolar world cannot solve humanity's many problems, where great powers extract benefits at the expense of less developed nations, a so-called zero-sum game.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the crisis unleashed by the pandemic is accelerating the decline of neoliberal globalization. New dangers arise because while neoliberal globalization has adverse effects on humanity, the alternatives proposed by some capitalist countries—closing borders, hindering international trade, and exacerbating unilateralist international relations—will undoubtedly make matters worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with this situation, we should propose that the crisis of neoliberal globalization can give way to a new form of global governance based on the multilateralization and lateralization of state relations, fostering mutually beneficial fair trade, abandoning the zero-sum game, and achieving a win-win situation for all, bringing about a profound change in the international order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, proposed by President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, advocates joining forces to achieve common goals, ensuring that everyone on Earth can enjoy a dignified life, and working together to tackle crises such as the one we are currently experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a community with a shared future not only enables us to cooperate, share resources, and accelerate our exit from the current critical situation, but also helps us establish a comprehensive and sustainable concept of common security for the well-being of all humanity, preventing situations like the current one from recurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can deny that in today's world, all countries and regions are completely interdependent. The challenge is to approach this interconnection from a cooperative perspective, sharing resources and technological advancements through collaboration, thereby amplifying the benefits of sharing, and establishing clear rules to help and protect the smallest and poorest nations from exploitation by great powers and developed countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the current emergency crisis demonstrates, crises do not respect national or continental borders. Therefore, we must strengthen international cooperation, enhance the role of the United Nations, and promote the values and principles enshrined in the UN Charter. Due to its comprehensive democracy and representativeness, and its control over numerous international economic organizations, the UN can better serve countries most affected by crises. Without an organization like the UN, global governance would be impossible. In this sense, international economic cooperation must undergo significant reforms, establish rules, and harness economic forces to improve the quality of life for those most affected by crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advances in productivity, technological progress, and major medical discoveries give us the ability to face emergencies like the current pandemic. To build a community with a shared future, we need to end neoliberal markets devoid of controls and moral constraints, while always adhering to the guiding principle that \"in the face of common human interests, national interests are merely a consideration.\" We must establish rules and controls, coordinate economic policies, and help countries emerge from the crisis while safeguarding the interests of all parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental issue to be addressed by international institutions in forging a new framework for political, economic, and cultural relations among nations is the design of a grand project to \"rebuild the Earth,\" capable of addressing the consequences of the current crisis. This grand project should have robust economic support and clear rules to prevent injustice, neocolonialism, or environmental degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To have a shared grand project for humanity, the government of the People's Republic of China, in collaboration with other countries and economic organizations, has developed initiatives and presented them forcefully before us. I refer to the \"Belt and Road\" Initiative, which is currently playing a crucial role in helping us overcome the global economic crisis that will hit the most vulnerable and unprotected countries the hardest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Belt and Road\" Initiative has become the largest international cooperation project in history. We propose that all countries globally view the Initiative as an opportunity, coordinate projects and resources, and reactivate the world economy. There is no doubt that the global economy is deeply burdened by the paralysis of global production.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, we must propose strengthening various initiatives, forums, and conferences to pressure the international community to urge different governments to set aside their differences, focus on the common good, and lead us towards that great \"community with a shared future,\" which is essential for us to confront the impacts of this global emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it is crucial for our civil society, citizen associations, and economic organizations to recognize that we need to learn from past experiences and understand that only by establishing a cooperative and collaborative relationship among all nations can we overcome the current emergency situation that causes us so much pain. We can achieve greater harmony, solidarity, and determination, transcending borders and races, uniting all people to build a great \"community with a shared future\" capable of successfully facing future challenges.\n",

      "According to the Workers' Daily, in recent years, some employers have signed so-called cooperation agreements with workers or employed them as apprentices or assistants, \"naturally\" renaming wages as \"allowances,\" \"living expenses,\" etc., blurring the actual labor relationship and creating significant difficulties for workers to protect their rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renaming wages and disguising them as something else is a trick employed by some companies to hide the labor relationship. The reasoning behind this is to mislead and confuse workers by using terms like \"allowances,\" \"living expenses,\" and \"cooperation commissions,\" thereby hindering workers' rights protection and reducing employment costs while avoiding responsibilities such as work-related injury insurance and social security contributions. This self-serving and irresponsible calculation cannot withstand legal scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The form in which wages are issued, whether under a different name or not, does not fundamentally affect, determine, or alter the genuine relationship between the employer and the worker. It also cannot negate the worker's rights and the employer's responsibilities. Even if wages are issued under the guise of \"allowances\" or \"living expenses,\" if the employer has not signed a labor contract with the worker or does not acknowledge the existence of a labor relationship, but the employer is a qualified employer and the worker is a qualified labor subject, and there is a relationship of personal dependence, economic dependence, and organizational dependence between the worker and the employer, then there is a de facto labor relationship between the employer and the worker. The employer's clever tactics will not succeed in the face of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, some employers, although they have signed \"equal\" cooperation agreements with workers or employed them as apprentices or assistants, paying compensation under the names of commissions or living expenses, as long as the workers are subject to the employer's arrangements and management, and the work provided or activities undertaken by the workers are part of the employer's business operations, and the employer regularly pays the workers the relevant compensation, the elements and conditions for confirming the existence of a de facto labor relationship between the employer and the worker are present. In some labor dispute cases, courts have also seen through certain employers' attempts to disguise labor relationships by using wage \"aliases,\" holding them accountable and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employers' practice of renaming wages is often not an isolated action; it is usually associated with a series of irresponsible operations such as not signing labor contracts, not paying social security contributions, not providing necessary labor safety and health conditions, and not guaranteeing related benefits. While employers may appear to benefit from these infringing operations in the short term, in the long run, they may find themselves outsmarted by their own cleverness, creating more labor dispute risks and potentially facing even greater costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labor Contract Law clearly states that where an employer has not entered into a written labor contract with a worker within one month of the start of employment but less than a year, the employer shall pay the worker twice the monthly wage. According to the Social Insurance Law, if an employer fails to pay social insurance premiums on time and in full, they must not only make up the shortfall but also pay additional late fees or fines. The Work-related Injury Insurance Regulations stipulate that if an employer is required to participate in work-related injury insurance but does not do so, and an employee suffers a work-related injury, the employer shall bear all the costs according to the work-related injury insurance benefits items and standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, this calculation is not difficult. The key lies in the external supervision that can compel employers to demonstrate sincerity and rationality in their calculations. Workers should not accept employers' infringing operations but should demand that employers sign written labor contracts, pay relevant social security contributions according to standards, and retain evidence such as recruitment registration forms, enrollment forms, sign-in sheets, work passes, and wage payment information. If they discover that they have been subjected to infringing calculations by employers, they can actively protect their rights through complaints, reports, labor arbitration, and legal action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labor arbitration institutions and courts should support workers' rights protection claims based on facts and law, safeguarding their rights. Human resources departments, trade unions, and other relevant bodies should strengthen legal education and labor supervision, efficiently handle complaints and reports, and correct employers' infringing operations that conceal labor relationships and evade employment responsibilities through means such as interviews, time-limited rectification, case investigations, and exposure. Through these efforts, employers can be effectively educated and encouraged to enhance their self-discipline, adhere to legal boundaries, standardize employment practices, and fully assume their employment responsibilities.\n",

      "Uruguayan avant-garde novelist, poet, journalist, and translator Cristina Peri Rossi was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the highest honor in Spanish-language literature, on April 22. She received a prize of €125,000, approximately RMB 880,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "The award ceremony was held in the auditorium of the University of Alcalá de Henares, 35 kilometers north of Madrid, the birthplace of the great writer and author of Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to health reasons, the 80-year-old Peri Rossi did not attend the ceremony in person. She remained in Barcelona and watched her friend, the 65-year-old Argentine actress Cecilia Roth, accept the award on her behalf from King Felipe VI via live stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the acceptance speech read by Roth, Peri Rossi recalled her childhood in Montevideo. Her uncle Tito, a communist and librarian, had a collection of three books that fascinated her the most: Anne Frank's Diary, Gorky's Mother, and Cervantes' Don Quixote. She particularly mentioned Marcela from Don Quixote, a young woman of noble birth who, despite being beautiful and reserved, suddenly ran away to the mountains to become a shepherdess. \"Countless young men and farmers' sons dressed up as shepherds and went to the mountains to pursue her,\" she said, but Marcela preferred to remain single and free. \"If anyone spoke of love to her, even with pure intentions, she would repel them like a sling,\" she added, describing how she ruined countless young men, who accused her of being a witch. Yet, Marcela defended herself eloquently, stating that she, a \"ferocious beast, a fairy, a cruel monster,\" did not seek, flatter, or court them. \"Why should I be required to remain chaste among men, but not in the mountains?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character Don Quixote in the book was, of course, captivated by her words and ordered his sword to prevent the lovesick men from bothering the young woman again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peri Rossi strongly identified with Marcela. \"I was well aware that, in a patriarchal society, a woman like Marcela, who is independent, is strange and suspicious,\" she said in her speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cristina Peri Rossi was born in Montevideo in 1941. At the age of 16, she first read Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex at the National Library of Uruguay, and in 1963, she made her literary debut with a collection of short stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "To escape the military dictatorship in Uruguay, she left her homeland in 1972 and has since lived in Barcelona. In Spain, through experimental writing and repeated exploration of political and sexual themes, she further solidified her reputation as a vanguard writer and grew into one of the most important contemporary Spanish-language authors. She has published nearly 40 works, including the well-known novel The Ship of Fools (La nave de los locos), written in 1984. In this novel, the male protagonist Ex decides to abandon sexual activity as a way to break with patriarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Peri Rossi published a memoir, Julio Cortázar y Cris, documenting her love and friendship with Argentine writer Julio Cortázar. Despite their 27-year age difference, one being petite and the other nearly two meters tall, they shared many interests: poetry, art museums, Joan Baez, dinosaurs, and the Loch Ness Monster. He wrote letters and poems for her continuously: Five Poems for Cris, Another Five Poems for Cris, and The Last Five Poems for Cris, praising her tears, saliva, and blood. Only after his death did she reciprocate with a poem of her own, beginning with:\n",

The previous five were Spanish writers María Zambrano (1988), Ana María Matute (2010), Cuban writer Dulce María Loynaz (1992), Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska (2013), and Uruguayan writer Ida Vitale (2018).\n",

      "The construction of modern agricultural industrial parks is a significant decision made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and it serves as a crucial tool for advancing agricultural modernization. At the end of 2016, the Central Rural Work Conference first proposed the \"construction of modern agricultural industrial parks,\" and this has been systematically deployed in the No. 1 Central Document each year since. Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance initiated the construction of national modern agricultural industrial parks in 2017, they have strengthened coordinated efforts, perfected support policies, enhanced guidance services, and solidly advanced the construction of modern agricultural industrial parks, leading and driving the revitalization of rural industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past five years, modern agricultural industrial parks have sprouted and taken root in fields across the country, receiving widespread affirmation from various levels of government and high praise from farmers. These parks have become important platforms for gathering modern resources, with each fruit representing total output values ranging from tens of billions to hundreds of billions of yuan. One by one, industries have formed new growth points for rural development... In the five years, numerous innovations and reforms have spread from point to surface, composing a magnificent chapter of high-quality and efficient development in Chinese agriculture.\n",

      "Grain stability brings national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on large-scale agriculture, building platform carriers that demonstrate and lead in a certain regional range is of great significance for stabilizing areas, increasing productivity, and solidifying the \"stabilizer\" of agriculture, rural areas, and farmers.\n",

      "\"Accelerate the construction of modern agricultural industrial systems, production systems, and operational systems, and create a high-starting point, high-standard modern agricultural development demonstration area...\" In March 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, closely surrounding the main line of pushing forward the supply-side structural reform of agriculture, painted a magnificent blueprint for the construction of modern agricultural industrial parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "11, 41, 62... After more than five years of creation, over 200 national modern agricultural industrial parks covering grain and oil, fruits and vegetables, livestock and poultry, seed industry, and other seven major industries have been established. These parks focus on building scaled farming bases, promoting high-standard farmland construction, perfecting advanced facilities such as greenhouses, factory seedling cultivation, breeding areas, and water-fertilizer integration, and integrating and demonstrating the promotion of new varieties, technologies, and equipment. They have formed one stable production and supply platform after another.\n",
      "\n",
      "540 kg, 542 kg, 545 kg... In the past three years, the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Yanjin County, Henan Province, has greatly demonstrated and promoted intensive production methods, achieving a steady increase in the average yield of wheat per mu. By promoting the formation of scientific and technological advantages, the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Suzhou District, Jiuquan, Gansu Province, has produced one-tenth of the corn seeds needed in China. Innovating with a self-owned intellectual property rights system for poultry breeding, the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Pinggu District, Beijing, has successfully bred five new egg-laying chicken varieties (companion systems), breaking the long-term monopoly of imported varieties in the Chinese market. Based on the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park platform, Fujin City, Heilongjiang Province, has integrated and complemented good fields, good seeds, and good methods, laying a solid foundation for stabilizing corn and soybean production...\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, the national modern agricultural industrial parks have focused on constructing major projects such as fine processing, storage, and circulation, addressing weaknesses in the industrial chain and supply chain. The \"Five Constant\" rice in Wuchang has achieved intelligent processing, and the peanut processing system in Zhengyang is comprehensive. The meat cattle industry in Bole has introduced fully automatic rapid precooling and acidification technologies... Currently, the upgrading of agricultural product processing and the construction of agricultural product storage, insurance, and cold chain logistics facilities have basically achieved full coverage in each national modern agricultural industrial park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the efficient production capacity and effective supply of national modern agricultural industrial parks have formed a huge force that comprehensively solidifies the foundation of food security and holds China's rice bowl steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "By creating a whole industrial chain of \"large base + fine processing + strong trade + high technology + deep integration,\" the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Fuling District, Chongqing City, has driven more than 160,000 farmers in the entire district to plant over 700,000 mu of turnips, with an annual total output value of over 12 billion yuan.\n",

      "The National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Xi County, Shanxi Province, takes the Swirly Pear as its leading industry, establishes a \"seed fund,\" and leverages social capital investment of up to 34 million yuan, paving a \"fast track\" for the development of characteristic industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhering to the principles of \"strengthening the park with science and technology, revitalizing the park with enterprises, gathering talents in the park, revitalizing land in the park, and attracting capital into the park,\" the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Dongliao County, Jilin Province, has become a \"world-famous poultry and egg industry height and the largest poultry and egg food processing base in Northeast Asia.\"\n",

      "Behind the emergence of batch after batch of rural industrial heights is a series of effective policy measures taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. These include gathering resources to build parks, innovating investment methods, expanding financial support channels for agriculture, guiding social capital investment, encouraging innovative land supply, and establishing talent mechanisms. It also includes the dynamic practice of national modern agricultural industrial parks following the requirements of \"production + processing + technology\" integrated development, opening up the path of advanced productive forces entering agriculture, promoting the extension of primary industry, the connection of secondary industry at both ends, and the upgrading of tertiary industry, and creating concentrated areas of industries that are special, strong, gathered, and beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data shows that after several years of construction, the national modern agricultural industrial parks have formed over 2,500 expert teams leading the industry, gathered 1,766 provincial-level agricultural industrialization leading enterprises, and leveraged social capital investment of 382.72 billion yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the average output value of national modern agricultural industrial parks has exceeded 80 billion yuan. Dozens of industrial parks that integrate production, processing, and sales, with output values exceeding 100 billion yuan, such as the Epo Bubble Tea, Qianjiang Crayfish, and Yanjin Wheat, have become brilliant industrial gems on the vast rural land, demonstrating strong development dynamics.\n",

      "Relying on the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park, Sichuan Province has explored the integration of production and villages, building 325 beautiful leisure villages and 97 characteristic towns, imbuing rural suburbs with poetic scenery. Jilin Province combines the construction of national modern agricultural industrial parks with leisure and sightseeing, and folk customs, expanding a group of small rural areas and characteristic towns where production, ecology, and life mutually promote each other, promoting the improvement of rural functions and the rural living environment. In the Tibet Autonomous Region, the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park integrates the development of industries with the spatial layout of villages, the construction of supporting infrastructure, the configuration of public services, and the construction of beautiful villages, opening up a new situation of in-depth integration between industry and villages.\n",

      "Promoting the continuous and stable growth of farmers' income and achieving common prosperity are the central tasks of the rural revitalization strategy and the starting point and destination of the construction of national modern agricultural industrial parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhering to the principle of \"agricultural-oriented, serving agriculture, benefiting agriculture, and developing agriculture\" in park construction, since the creation of national modern agricultural industrial parks, a work mechanism has been established with the coordination of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, the overall planning of provincial governments, and the specific promotion of counties and cities. Efforts have been made to improve and perfect the mechanism of linking farmers' interests, leaving the value-added earnings and employment opportunities of the agricultural industrial chain to farmers, and enabling farmers to share more in the achievements of industrial park development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking advantage of the east wind of national modern agricultural industrial park construction, local authorities have actively innovated in profit distribution models. Areas like Hebei, Ningxia, and Sichuan have explored the model of \"four golds from one land,\" where farmers gain rent from land transfer, salaries from employment in the park, cash from family management, and dividends from shareholding. In Shandong and other places, industrial parks have generally established close interest linkage mechanisms such as \"leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers,\" continuously innovating and perfecting models like \"orderly acquisition + dividends\" and \"guaranteed income + share dividends,\" transforming the buying and selling relationship between farmers and processing enterprises into a cooperative relationship. The industrial parks in Henan have explored shareholding methods, enabling farmers to share land and assets, forming a closely linked relationship...\n",
      "\n",
      "According to statistics, by the end of 2021, nearly 70% of the farmers in the 200 national industrial parks had established interest linkage relationships with various new operational entities. The per capita disposable income of farmers in these parks reached 28,600 yuan, nearly double the national average. Moreover, the radiation effect of the national modern agricultural industrial parks is expanding the \"dual-win\" situation of agricultural productivity increase and farmer income growth from point to surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next step, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance will deeply implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, continue to implement the relevant decisions of the Central Committee and the State Council, focus on strengthening coordination, policies, guidance, and services, and construct a batch of industrial parks with obvious advantages and characteristics, complete industrial chains, gathered resources and elements, close linkage with farmers, and flexible mechanism innovation. They will drive the improvement of industrial park construction levels in various regions, promote the park-ization of agriculture, the industrialization of parks, and the clustering of industries, and create a high-quality and efficient leading area for agriculture, a model area for rural livability and employability, and a display area for farmers' prosperity. These efforts will provide a solid foundation for accelerating the construction of an agricultural powerhouse and fully advancing rural revitalization.\n",

      "■ Liang Heng\n",
      "The mountains of Guizhou crowd together, with winding roads and scattered Miao and Buyi villages in the folds. In March, we visited Kaiyang County, just as the rapeseed flowers were in full bloom. As far as the eye could see along the mountain road, it was a sea of gold, with a faint floral scent carried by the breeze. We traveled through this vast sea of flowers and endless fragrance, with the air always containing a misty rain that washed the green mountains on either side and the flower trees by the road, making them shine. White pear blossoms, red peach blossoms, yellow welcoming blossoms, green paulownia flowers, and strings of purple jacaranda blossoms all vied to showcase their beauty in this spring month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car cut through the flower sea and stopped in front of a Miao village, a tourist spot. Up the slope, a welcoming team with strong folk customs was already in place. Men danced and played long flutes, while women wore silver ornaments from head to shoulder, their jingling and flashing creating a spectacle. They held up bottles of welcome wine with both hands, urging guests to take a sip. Turning right up the hill into the village, there was a flat field where a large flagpole stood, with drums and musical instruments arranged beneath it. An elder struck the drum, setting the rhythm, while a group of men and women in Miao clothes and skirts danced joyfully in a large circle. I knew this was a program for rural tourism. Around the perimeter of the field were many small baskets filled with folk crafts. A young girl of around six squatted nearby, her bright eyes shining beneath a gleaming silver headpiece. Intrigued, I squatted down to chat with her. \"Is this small basket yours?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why are you here by yourself?\" \"My mom is here.\" \"Where did your mom go?\" She pouted her lips and pointed to the field, saying, \"My mom went dancing.\" Looking back at the field, I saw silver jewelry ringing, skirts fluttering, and flute and drum music weaving through bamboo trees, echoing endlessly between the village towers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the Miao village, we headed towards a Buyi village. As the wind blew, mountain peach and plum blossoms fell in pale white and deep red, covering the winding mountain road like a colorful wax-dyed silk cloth. Even Liu Haisu's \"Ten Visits to Huangshan for Sketching\" could not find such a picturesque scene. As we approached the village, more and more peach petals danced in the air, and I reached out with joy to catch the flying red. The host said, \"We are about to hold the Buyi Cultural Festival and the provincial singing competition. The winning male and female singers will receive a prize of 10,000 yuan each.\" No wonder there was always a faint song in my ears as we walked along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then, several Buyi girls passed by with hoes and baskets, their simple blue clothes and headscarves contrasting with the Miao girls' elaborate silver headpieces. The sunlight gave them rosy cheeks, and the wind by the water made their movements graceful. The rapeseed flower petals on their pant legs were fresh from the field, and more red peach blossoms fell on their shoulders as they chatted and hummed a tune. They were clearly returning from the fields to participate in the singing competition. Watching their departing figures, a poem spontaneously arose in my mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "In front of the village, who is that Buyi girl,\n",
      "In March, she goes to compete in singing.\n",
      "Unbothered by the wet red petals on her shoulders,\n",
      "She leaves the fallen flowers as her bridal gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "This made me envious. The young white-collar workers and IT elites who had just graduated in the city were probably about the same age as these girls. Yet, where was their freedom? Confined in their small cubicles in skyscrapers, they boasted of the grandeur of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou while lamenting their \"enormous pressure.\" If there was a job that could combine earning money with aesthetics and entertainment, that would be ideal. I remember world ping pong champion Zhuang Zedong saying that when he was a little boy, he dreamed of a job that was both fun and allowed him to live well. He found it in playing ping pong. But the singing and dancing of the people in the mountains is even better, and it's right at their doorstep. I told my companions that the two deepest impressions from this trip were hearing the little girl in the Miao village say, \"My mom went dancing,\" and meeting the Buyi girls in the flower rain on their way to the singing competition, realizing that the people in the mountains had such a way of life. I was also reminded of my visit to Lugu Lake on the Sichuan-Yunnan border, where the local girls said, \"In the past, our job was to gather firewood and sing, and now it's tourism development and singing.\" The \"Bada Mi\" Lugu love song still floats through my ears from time to time.\n",

      "This is a way of life that has not yet been polluted by the hustle and bustle of the city, and it has already injected a breath of fresh air from the new era. It is a modern Shangri-La.\n",

      "\n",
      "Li stated that the China International Supply Chain Promotion Expo is the world's first national-level exhibition focused on supply chains. Currently, the global economic recovery is challenging. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is a crucial guarantee for driving global economic development. Consolidating and strengthening global cooperation in industrial and supply chains serves the interests and urgent expectations of all parties. China's hosting of the Expo aims to respond to the call of the times and create an international platform to promote enhanced communication, deeper cooperation, and common development among all parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li emphasized that history and reality have proven that when global industrial and supply chain cooperation remains stable and deepens continuously, all countries benefit universally. Conversely, when this cooperation is obstructed or stagnates, all countries suffer. China is not only a participant in and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation but also a firm maintainer and builder. The Chinese side is willing to work together with all parties to make global industrial and supply chains more resilient, efficient, and vibrant, thereby making greater contributions to promoting global economic recovery and worldwide development and prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li proposed four initiatives to deepen international cooperation in industrial and supply chains: First, jointly build secure and stable industrial and supply chains. Strengthen resource coordination in key industrial chains on a global scale and avoid arbitrary interference in market behavior. China will continue to provide the world with high-quality \"Made in China\" products and a stable Chinese supply. Second, jointly build smooth and efficient industrial and supply chains. Further enhance global connectivity to facilitate the more seamless circulation and effective allocation of factors. China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation and strengthen innovation cooperation in areas such as smart manufacturing and the digital economy. Third, jointly build open and inclusive industrial and supply chains. Firmly oppose protectionism and all forms of \"decoupling,\" while striving to promote the green and low-carbon transformation of industrial and supply chains. China will integrate more deeply into the global industrial and supply chain system and actively engage in international cooperation in green development. Fourth, jointly build mutually beneficial and win-win industrial and supply chains. Drive the construction of a global industrial and supply chain system that involves broad participation, complementary advantages, and shared benefits. China will actively advance industrial and capacity cooperation with various countries, facilitating the deeper involvement of developing nations in global value chains. Li expressed hope that business leaders from various countries will play an active role in promoting the steady operation of global industrial and supply chains. China will provide more conveniences and better safeguards for foreign companies investing and doing business in China.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anshun's ambitious plans for its aviation industry are rooted in its solid aviation foundation. The city's aviation industry began during the \"Three-Line Construction\" period, when several military-industrial companies, such as Gui Fei and An Da, settled in the area. These companies significantly contributed to China's national defense and laid a solid foundation for the city's industrialization.\n",

      "Stepping into Guizhou Liyang International Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Liyang Aviation), one is greeted by the rhythmic hum of machinery and a bustling production floor filled with equipment and meticulously organized aviation engine core components. Born out of the \"Three-Line Construction\" era, this company boldly embraced strategic partnerships, emerging as a prominent player in the international aviation subcontracting market and a trusted supplier for major industry giants. With a loyal customer base including Safran (France), Nuovo Pignone (Italy), General Electric (USA), UTAS (USA), Rolls-Royce (UK), and Halliburton (USA), Liyang Aviation has made a significant impact on the international stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, Liyang Aviation has also made notable strides in the domestic market. In 2021, the company delivered a low-pressure turbine rear support component to the Commercial Aircraft Engine Co., Ltd. (CAEC) of China Aviation Engine Corporation (AECC), marking a transition from component production to large-scale assembly manufacturing. In 2022, building on its existing supply capabilities, Liyang Aviation secured a production order for the fan shaft of the CJ2000 large aircraft project.\n",

The focus of this inspection was on deepening reform and driving the better development of the capital, especially solving the challenges of a mega-city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhao Li, former deputy director of the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall, vividly recalls the scene: \"The General Secretary thoroughly understood Beijing's geographical environment, planning layout, and functional positioning. He asked very detailed questions. He was particularly concerned about the issues facing Beijing's development, such as excessive population, traffic congestion, rising housing prices, and severe ecological environment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "General Secretary Xi has made a series of important instructions on the crucial issue of \"building what kind of capital city and how to build it\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- In February 2014, at a symposium held in Beijing, General Secretary Xi proposed the major national strategy of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development, emphasizing that solving Beijing's development problems must be considered within the strategic space of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Bohai Rim Economic Circle to facilitate the flow of resources and better showcase Beijing's advantages.\n",
      "- In February 2017, during his inspection of Beijing, General Secretary Xi stressed that relieving non-capital functions from Beijing is the key to its urban planning and construction.\n",
      "- At the beginning of 2019, General Secretary Xi visited the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei, Tianjin, and Beijing to understand the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. He required the \"reorganization of the old city in the center of Beijing\" and the \"high-quality development of the Beijing sub-center\"...\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the personal planning, deployment, and promotion of General Secretary Xi, Beijing has entered a new stage of development characterized by major adjustments, upgrades, and coordination. With the relief of non-capital functions as the key, Beijing aims to solve its \"big city diseases\" and promote the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, becoming a clear direction and important mission for the capital's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing the important instructions of General Secretary Xi, Beijing has pursued high-quality development and an overall upgrade of urban functions through reduction-based development: releasing the first national industrial prohibition and restriction directory aimed at governing \"big city diseases,\" phasing out approximately 3,000 general manufacturing and polluting enterprises since 2014, upgrading nearly 1,000 regional wholesale markets and logistics centers, and accelerating the complementation of convenient service facilities...\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing's spatial layout and economic structure have been optimized and upgraded, air quality has continuously improved, and residents' living environment has become more beautiful. Simultaneously, it has driven the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development to a higher level, accelerating the construction of integrated transportation and the upgrading and transfer of industries, as well as innovation collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Secretary Xi pointed out: \"Building the sub-center of Beijing is an important link in promoting the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and relieving non-capital functions from Beijing.\" During his inspection of Beijing in February 2017, the General Secretary came to the Forest Park of the Grand Canal, overlooking the entire construction of the Beijing sub-center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, along the Grand Canal, the construction framework of the Beijing sub-center is gradually taking shape, transforming former shanty towns into the Canal Business District. In November 2021, the State Council issued the \"Opinions on Supporting the High-Quality Development of the Beijing Sub-Center,\" making this area full of vitality and entrepreneurial enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing will continue to implement the \"Outline of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Plan,\" strengthen cooperation with Tianjin and Hebei, take the relief of non-capital functions as a starting point, expand its hinterland for support, and follow the path of integration to build a modern capital metropolitan area, further driving the formation of a world-class city cluster in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\n",

      "\"Developing and protecting in the midst of protection\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eve of the 2019 Spring Festival, General Secretary Xi inspected and comforted grassroots officials and residents in Beijing, walking along Caofang Hutong in the Dashilan area. He pointed out that the distinctive feature of old Beijing is its hutongs, and it is essential to preserve their characteristics, allowing the city to retain its memory and evoke nostalgia among its residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing has a history of over 3,000 years of city building and 860 years as the capital, making its rich historical and cultural heritage a golden business card. In General Secretary Xi's heart, the protection of the ancient capital and the lives of the people in the hutongs are both historical responsibilities and contemporary challenges in Beijing's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his inspections of Beijing, General Secretary Xi has repeatedly provided important instructions on protecting the city's historical and cultural heritage, requiring a balance between urban renovation and development, and heritage preservation and utilization. He emphasized, \"We should preserve the cultural bottom line while ensuring that the residents of the hutongs live modern lives. We must combine these two aspects effectively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2014, General Secretary Xi visited the Nanluoguxiang area, entering courtyards at 29 and 30 Yuer Hutong. \"I am very familiar with this hutong area. I came today to visit the old neighbors and listen to their thoughts on the renovation of the old city.\" General Secretary Xi pointed out that the renovation of the old city should address diverse wishes and demands, and the relevant departments should conduct thorough and detailed work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the important instructions of General Secretary Xi, Beijing has intensified its efforts in renovating the old city, innovating its renovation methods. In some old urban areas, residents can choose to stay or relocate voluntarily. Those who relocate are provided with modern apartment buildings, while those who stay benefit from improved living conditions through the utilization of vacated spaces, equipped with modern kitchens, bathrooms, and other facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the advancement of old city protection and renovation, the hutongs inspected by General Secretary Xi have undergone a remarkable transformation. In Yuer Hutong 30, the reporter observed that the illegal constructions had been removed, and the ground was transformed into a green space. The courtyard has been restored to its former rustic charm with gray bricks, gray tiles, red doors, and green lattice windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Beijing launched the three-year action plan for environmental improvement and enhancement of back streets and alleys in the capital's core area, transforming over 3,000 streets and alleys. In March 2021, the newly revised \"Regulations on the Protection of Beijing's Historical and Cultural Famous City\" came into effect, providing legal protection for preserving the old city's appearance. The same year, the \"Beijing Historical and Cultural Famous City Protection and Development Plan for the 14th Five-Year Plan\" was approved, clearly outlining key tasks such as strengthening the protection and restoration of historical water systems...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, the scene of 'water flowing through the alleys' has reappeared, and the historical and cultural streets have been restoratively rebuilt. Beijing's old city protection work is progressing step by step.\" Said Chen Mingjie, director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics, \"In the future, we will take the opportunity of the Beijing Central Axis World Heritage protection work to inject new vitality into the prosperity and development of Beijing's historical and cultural heritage.\"\n",

      "With the successful hosting of the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Beijing became a \"dual-Olympics city.\" General Secretary Xi has set clear requirements for utilizing the Winter Olympics legacy to drive high-quality development: \"We should actively plan and continue our efforts, managing and utilizing the Beijing Winter Olympics legacy effectively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-Games utilization of Olympic venues is a global challenge and a concern of General Secretary Xi. From the bid to the preparation and finally the successful hosting, the General Secretary inspected the venues five times in five years, repeatedly emphasizing, \"Hosting the Winter Olympics is not a one-time deal,\" and \"We should combine the needs of the Games with post-Games utilization, avoiding extravagance and redundant construction...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Located along the Beijing Central Axis, the National Speed Skating Oval, nicknamed \"Ice Ribbon,\" stands out. On January 4th of this year, General Secretary Xi visited the venue, pointing out that \"whether it is a newly built venue or a renovated one, we should pay attention to comprehensive utilization and low-carbon usage, integrating various functions such as sports events, public fitness, cultural leisure, exhibitions, and social public welfare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Xiaonan, director of the National Speed Skating Oval operation team, said, \"The General Secretary's important instructions have provided a clear direction for the long-term sustainable development of the 'Ice Ribbon.' We aim to make it a city sports complex and a calling card for China's ice and snow sports development.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, each Winter Olympics venue is opening a spectacular post-Olympics era. The Beijing Yanqing Olympic Zone is officially open to the public, the Big Air Shougang has become a popular check-in spot, the \"Ice Cube\" faithfully recreates the Winter Olympics scene... Beijing, as a \"dual-Olympics city,\" offers a \"Chinese solution\" for the post-Games utilization of Olympic venues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As required by General Secretary Xi, Beijing has leveraged the Winter Olympics to drive comprehensive development, striving to submit two excellent reports: one on the successful hosting of the Olympics and the other on local development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on the Winter Olympics and key industries, Beijing Yanqing is developing into an international skiing tourism resort, constructing ice and snow venues for the public, and promoting the deep integration of ice and snow sports with tourism and other industries, providing higher-level employment opportunities for local residents. Beijing Shougang Park hosts public fitness activities, sports events, and cultural activities, becoming a new city landmark. The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway connects the \"one-hour economic circle\" between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and the Beijing-Zhangjiakou sports and cultural tourism belt is under accelerated construction, aiming to become a high-quality development hub for culture and tourism...\n",
      "\n",

      "There are quite a few private traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics in Hong Kong, and the doctors are experienced in outpatient consultations, but they have fewer opportunities to gain practical experience in wards. Lin Bei-yin, vice president of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Physicians Association, pointed out that although there are nearly 10,000 TCM physicians in Hong Kong, relatively few have worked in the public healthcare system. Many are not familiar with the ward environment, collaborative methods between Chinese and Western medicine, and clinical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"TCM physicians with hospital practical experience are relatively rare in Hong Kong,\" said Lin. While such talent can be imported from the Chinese mainland as a temporary solution, it is essential to develop local talent in the long run. \"We should leverage the expertise of senior TCM physicians from the mainland to help train Hong Kong's TCM physicians. The training should not only impart knowledge and skills but also provide practical experience in suitable environments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin suggested that the first step is to allow TCM physicians to work in public hospital wards for training and further studies. \"Reliance on face-to-face or book-based learning alone cannot produce TCM physicians with practical experience. After all, healthcare is a clinical practice, and it is challenging to master it solely through reading.\" She noted that three universities in Hong Kong offer full-time TCM bachelor's degree programs, and students currently need to intern in mainland Chinese hospitals for several months to gain clinical experience. \"In the future, we hope that students can intern in public hospital wards under the Hospital Authority, with additional content on how Chinese and Western medicine collaborate and related testing training, enriching the clinical experience of the next generation of TCM students.\"\n",

      "It is said that 2,300 years ago, Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River at Huaisa. Upon hearing the news, people from both banks rushed to rescue and recover his body by throwing zongzi into the river to feed the fish and shrimp, preventing them from harming Qu Yuan's remains. Over time, dragon boat racing, eating zongzi, hanging calamus, placing mugwort, and wearing perfume bags became important ways for people to commemorate Qu Yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the passage of a thousand years, the people of Miluo's feelings for Qu Yuan have not faded but have become even more intense. In the mouths of the Miluo people, the address for Qu Yuan is not the official-sounding \"Third Section Lord\" or \"Qu Lord,\" but the very affectionate \"Old Master Qu,\" and even \"Father Qu,\" a term used to address elderly family members.\n",

Receiving the mandate, it does not move, born in the southern country...\" Led by Liu Weicheng, director of the Hubei Provincial Library and the Hubei Ancient Books Protection Center, readers jointly recited Qu Yuan's \"Ode to the Orange.\" \"In the 'Ode to the Orange,' Qu Yuan declared his ambition to maintain his pure moral character and be forever loyal to his homeland,\" Liu Weicheng explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vast and diverse ancient literature and documents are important manifestations of the achievements of Chinese civilization. The Hubei Provincial Library hopes to guide readers to read these classics and feel the charm of traditional culture. The participation of many readers, especially young ones, greatly encouraged Liu Weicheng. \"Whether it's the unwavering determination of 'firm and unmoving, holding to one's resolve,' the pristine integrity of 'everyone is drunk but I am sober,' or the indomitable spirit of 'the path is long and far, but I will seek until the end,' these are inexhaustible motivations for personal struggle and the spiritual source of the Chinese nation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like many traditional festivals, the Dragon Boat Festival originally aimed to seek good fortune and ward off evil spirits during the midsummer heat. Later, it evolved to commemorate Qu Yuan and Cao E, becoming richer in theme. However, the most crucial aspect is that, because of its close association with the legend of Qu Yuan, it became a unique festival that gathers the 'roots' and 'soul' of the Chinese nation,\" Liu Shilin stated.\n",

      "\"On this good day of the fifth month, a tale heard throughout the ages, for Qu Yuan, a patriot who valued his country above his life, a spirit of patriotism that endures through generations...\" In the Lotus Square of Yudu County, Jiangxi Province, Xia Shulin, an inheritor of ancient Kejia (Hakka) literature, sat upright, playing the erhu (a two-stringed bowed instrument) and narrating the story of Qu Yuan in the Kejia dialect, accompanied by a rhythm of ups and downs. Tourists passing by stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On this red land of Yudu, there are countless people like Qu Yuan who patriotically devoted themselves and sacrificed for the country,\" Xia Shulin said. To write the lyrics for this Dragon Boat Festival, the over-seventy-year-old Xia Shulin spent half a month immersing himself in the local cultural museum, taking notes on the stories of the Red Army, which he incorporated into his ancient literature performance, hoping to tell the stories of his ancestors' patriotism in an engaging way.\n",

The museum consists of an exhibition and experience area, a hot rice dumpling immediate packaging and cooking area, an intangible heritage rice dumpling creative gift box and souvenir sales area, vividly displaying the agricultural rice culture of the Poyang Lake area, the history of rice dumplings, and the intangible heritage techniques of making dumplings. With the enhancement of culture, dumplings have been upgraded from common street food to a rich experience that can be visited, felt, tasted, and remembered.\n",

      "Making the people happy is the CPC's unwavering value pursuit, embodying the political attributes of a Marxist party, reflecting the CPC's fundamental purpose, and serving as the starting and ending point of realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the people happy, the CPC must persist in the people-centered development philosophy and better meet the people's growing needs for a better life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insisting on development is the hard truth. Development is the Party's top priority for governing and revitalizing the country and the key to solving all problems in China. In the new era, the people's aspirations for a better life are stronger than ever. They expect better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory incomes, more reliable social security, higher-level healthcare services, more comfortable living conditions, a more beautiful environment, and a richer spiritual and cultural life. They hope their children can grow up, work, and live better. These aspirations provide a clear direction and inexhaustible motivation for China's development. To make the people happy, development is the hard truth. Since the 18th National Congress, the CPC has insisted on advancing high-quality development and responding to the people's expectations with practical benefits, making continuous progress in areas such as education, healthcare, employment, and social security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing the Party's mass line. The mass line is the lifeline and fundamental work line of the CPC, a valuable legacy that keeps the Party youthful and vibrant. To make the people happy and center them in development, the CPC must follow the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly and rely on them to turn the Party's correct theories into voluntary actions. Serving the people wholeheartedly means putting the people's concerns, hopes, and aspirations at the forefront when formulating reforms and policies, ensuring that reforms benefit the people and enhance their sense of gain. Relying on the people means mobilizing them to participate in socialist modernization construction and create a happy and beautiful life with their wisdom and strength. Working among the people means understanding their wishes and demands for a happy life and using them as the direction and motivation for reform and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring the people share in the fruits of reform and development. Xi has noted, \"It is an essential requirement of socialism and a vivid manifestation of the Party's fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people that the broad masses of the people share in the fruits of reform and development.\" Centering the people in development and making them happy requires ensuring that they share in the benefits of reform and development and moving towards common prosperity. In the new era, China's social contradiction has evolved into one between the people's growing needs for a better life and the uneven and inadequate development. Resolving this contradiction demands more balanced and adequate development to address shortcomings in living standards, guarantee equal participation and development rights, promote social fairness and justice, and strive to meet the pursuit and expectations of all people for a happy life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making the people happy should be integrated into every aspect of state governance, striving to do practical work that meets the people's urgent, practical, and reasonable needs. While promoting high-quality economic development, efforts should be made to strengthen and innovate social governance and further guarantee and improve people's livelihoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driving high-quality economic development. Xi has pointed out, \"High-quality development can better meet the people's growing needs for a better life.\" To make the people happy, the CPC has made high-quality development a fundamental requirement for formulating development strategies, economic policies, and macroeconomic regulations. By prioritizing quality and efficiency, the CPC aims to drive economic development through quality, efficiency, and motivation upgrades, enhancing economic innovation and competitiveness. High-quality economic development is closely related to the people's happiness. In the first half of 2019, per capita disposable income in China reached 15,294 yuan, a nominal year-on-year increase of 8.8%, with per capita wage income at 8,793 yuan, a nominal increase of 8.7%. High-quality economic development is creating more favorable conditions and laying a better material foundation for the people's happy life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening and innovating social governance. Xi has stated, \"Social governance is a science. Either too much control, resulting in stagnation, or too little, leading to chaos, is unacceptable.\" Only by strengthening and innovating social governance, maintaining social harmony and stability, can the people's happy life be guaranteed. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi at its core, China has strengthened and innovated social governance since the 18th National Congress, combining targeted governance with systematic, comprehensive, and law-based approaches, and adhering to the path of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics. It has formed a social governance pattern of co-construction, co-governance, and shared benefits, establishing a community of shared responsibility for social governance, and continuously improving its system. China's social security and stability have improved, and the safety and property of the people are effectively protected, enhancing their sense of security and satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guaranteeing and improving people's livelihoods. Xi has emphasized, \"We must guarantee and improve people's livelihoods, giving priority to public service projects and addressing prominent issues such as difficulties in schooling, healthcare, and transportation that the people strongly reflect on.\" Making the people happy is a practical and tangible goal that should be reflected in their daily life and manifested in solving livelihood issues. Since the 18th National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi at its core has regarded guaranteeing and improving people's livelihoods as a crucial task for making the people happy. It has addressed the most pressing and direct interests of the people in areas such as education, employment, income distribution, social security, and healthcare, implementing livelihood projects with a strong sense of responsibility, targeting poverty alleviation, promoting employment and income growth, strengthening social security, and enhancing the people's sense of gain and happiness.\n",

      "Since the beginning of 2022, numerous \"mortgage tribes\" burdened with housing loans and \"just-need tribes\" urgently needing to enter the market have seen multiple favorable developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since February 17, media outlets have consecutively reported that many banks in areas such as Heze, Shandong, Chongqing, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, and Foshan, Guangdong, have reduced the first-time home buyer's down payment ratio to 20%. So far this year, over 40 cities nationwide have successively released various degrees of micro-adjustment policies for the real estate market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, mortgage interest rates seem to be entering a new round of downward adjustment. On February 21, data from the Key Cities' Mainstream Mortgage Interest Rates released by Shell Research Institute showed that the mainstream first-time home buyer's mortgage interest rate in 103 key cities monitored in February was 5.47%, and the second-time home buyer's rate was 5.75%, both falling by 9 basis points compared to the previous month. The average loan issuance period was 38 days, 12 days shorter than the previous month.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Xu Xiaole, Chief Market Analyst at Shell Research Institute, stated that in January this year, the adjustment of the 5-year LPR downward led to a decrease in mortgage interest rates in February. \"The decline in mortgage interest rates in February widened, with interest rates approaching the level of May last year, and the loan issuance period accelerated to the state in the third quarter of 2020. This is a manifestation of the relaxation of the housing credit environment, which will play a more active role in improving market expectations and accelerating market transactions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 21, there was also news that the four major state-owned banks in the Guangzhou area synchronously adjusted their mortgage interest rates downward. Relevant personnel from the four state-owned banks confirmed the above news to the 21st Century Business Herald. At the same time, multiple industry insiders told the reporter that now, the amount of bank mortgage loans is generally sufficient, and the approval process has been accelerated, with a significant shortening of the loan issuance period. There is a possibility of further downward adjustment of mortgage interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts attribute this to supply and demand relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 21, media reports stated that the four major state-owned banks synchronously adjusted downward the mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area, with the first-time home buyer's rate decreasing from LPR + 100 BP (5.6%) to LPR + 80 BP (5.4%), and the second-time home buyer's rate decreasing from LPR + 120 BP (5.8%) to LPR + 100 BP (5.6%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding this, the four major banks all told the reporter that their mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area would be executed at the above prices from February 21. At the same time, the reporter also learned that Bank of Communications has followed up on the adjustment of mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area, and China Post Bank will lower its mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area from February 22, both consistent with the four major banks. Multiple joint-stock banks also revealed to the reporter that they have followed the lead of the large state-owned banks and lowered their mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area to 5.4% for the first-time home buyers and 5.6% for the second-time home buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large state-owned bank in Guangzhou stated that the bank will continue to adhere to the positioning of \"housing, not speculation,\" giving priority to supporting the needs of first-time buyers and those with urgent housing needs. For customers who have met the loan issuance conditions, loans will be issued in order of application time. \"Currently, there is no backlog of businesses that meet the loan issuance conditions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the collective downward adjustment of mortgage interest rates in the Guangzhou area by the four major state-owned banks, Li Yujia, Chief Researcher at the Guangdong Housing Policy Research Center, believes that this is a voluntary act by banks due to supply and demand relationships, not a nationwide adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In January, the volume of new house transactions in Guangzhou was less than 6,000 sets, far below the monthly average of 8,000-9,000 sets since 2016. While second-hand residential transactions (self-assisted online signing + brokerage online signing) were 7,014 sets, a significant decrease of 55.4% year-on-year, and have been hovering at a low level of 5,000-7,000 sets since May 2021,\" Li Yujia stated. \"When the overall transaction volume declines, the demand for mortgages will decrease, leading to a reversal of the supply and demand relationship for mortgages, resulting in a decrease in interest rates. Banks need to do business, so they can only lower interest rates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first three quarters of 2021, due to the rapid increase in housing prices in Guangzhou, under the mode of \"one city, one policy\" in quota control and credit policies, mortgage interest rates continued to rise. Data shows that in the first three quarters of 2021, Guangzhou's housing loan interest rates increased five times consecutively, and mainstream commercial banks in the Guangzhou area maintained first-time and second-time home buyer's loan interest rates of no less than 5.85% and 6.05%, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Yujia further pointed out that currently, under the new framework of stability first and progressive stability, excessively high mortgage interest rates affect market stability and hinder housing consumption needs. There is a demand for downward adjustment. \"At present, market demand is still relatively weak. Lowering mortgage interest rates and forming a sustained downward expectation will help activate demand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 21, the National Bureau of Statistics released the January data on the price changes of commercial residential properties in 70 large and medium-sized cities, showing that the price of newly built commercial residential properties in Guangzhou increased by 0.5% month-on-month, reversing the previous downward trend. \"It is expected that the sustained downward adjustment of mainstream banks' mortgage interest rates will have a significant impact on transaction activity and market demand, and the market will return to the transaction level of normal times,\" Li Yujia stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housing market will stabilize under the long-term mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the view of industry insiders, there is still room for further downward adjustment of mortgage interest rates in Guangzhou, indicating that the real estate policy is further relaxing and has positive demonstrative significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yan Yuejin, Research Director of the Think Tank Center at E-House China Research, believes that mortgage interest rate policies in cities like Guangzhou objectively have positive inspirational significance for other cities nationwide, which will help produce positive demonstrative effects on subsequent policies in other cities. \"Currently, the real estate market is at the end of the cooling period since the second half of last year. This year, it will show a 'V' shape, that is, it is constantly entering the stage of market bottoming out, hitting the bottom, and probing the bottom, and will subsequently form a very good foundation for bottom rebound and gradual recovery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Does this mean that, starting with Guangzhou, the mortgage interest rates in hot cities will enter a significant downward adjustment period?\n",
      "\n",
      "In Li Yujia's opinion, since the LPR remains unchanged, the impact of the add-on is only marginal. In January, the 5-year LPR, which serves as the benchmark for mortgage interest rates, was adjusted downward by 5 basis points. However, the latest LPR did not show any adjustment. \"The regulatory authorities may consider that the market is recovering, and various places are actively resolving difficulties, which has already activated the market to a certain extent. They worry that another downward adjustment of the LPR may lead to an overly obvious rebound. In general, under the long-term mechanism framework, the housing market will stabilize but is unlikely to rise significantly.\" Li Yujia pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the housing market has not yet shown a significant warming trend. Wang Qing, Chief Analyst at Oriental Jincheng, believes that to curb the downward trend of the housing market, the next step will also be a policy focus on lowering personal housing loan interest rates through the downward adjustment of the 5-year LPR quote.\n",

The caller's father had diabetes, and their insulin supply had run out, requiring immediate injection treatment. Since the father lived in a sealed-off area, he could not go out to buy medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the urgency of the situation, the Changchun Municipal Public Security Bureau 110 Command Center directed a point-to-point command, immediately transferring the case to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) squad on patrol nearby. The police quickly purchased insulin from a pharmacy and drove to Beidaiyingson Village, securing the medicine to a UAV delivery mechanism for aerial delivery. Due to uncertainty about the caller's specific location, the police contacted the caller via phone while searching the air with the UAV. At 4:15 p.m. that day, after confirming the patient's location, the UAV delivered the medicine precisely, successfully completing the rescue mission and alleviating the public's urgent need.\n",

      "Around midnight on March 19th, the Guanghua epidemic prevention and control traffic checkpoint in Tonghua County intercepted a private car. After questioning by the duty police, they learned that a 28-day-old infant in Guanghua Town, belonging to the Pang family, had experienced respiratory distress due to milk aspiration and was in a semi-comatose state, urgently needing medical treatment. Due to snowfall during the day, the highway entrance was closed, creating a critical situation. The child's family was extremely anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "After understanding the situation, the duty police immediately reported to the leadership of the Tonghua County Public Security Bureau and the Intelligence and Command Center, coordinating with relevant departments to lift the closure of the highway entrance. Simultaneously, they quickly verified the travel history and nucleic acid test results of Mr. and Mrs. Pang, calming their agitated emotions. After the highway entrance was reopened, due to snowfall and temperature drops, causing icy and slippery road conditions, the police, to prevent any accidents during Mr. Pang's driving, escorted them throughout the journey while ensuring the normal operation of the checkpoint. Upon arrival at the hospital, Officer Li Feng from the checkpoint proactively assisted the Pangs with registration and payment procedures. After emergency treatment by the doctors, the infant's condition stabilized.\n",

      "Due to work requirements, the Qingdao Survey Team of the National Bureau of Statistics adjusted its party branches, establishing six new party branches in February 2019. Over the past three years, the third party branch of the Qingdao team has regarded theme party day activities as an effective carrier for improving branch organizational life. They have insisted on using theme party day activities with \"three characteristics\" and \"six requirements,\" adding \"party flavor,\" \"freshness,\" and \"sentiment\" to branch organizational life, bringing the branch to life, motivating party members, and making their roles more prominent.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 5, 2019, the branch organized all party members to conduct the first theme party day activity after its establishment— \"Wear Party Badges, Set a Pioneering Image,\" which included a collective review of the party oath and learning to wear party badges. The strong sense of ceremony made the theme party day activity memorable for branch party members to this day. Throughout, the branch's theme party day activities have always emphasized political nature as their prominent theme, making \"theme party day activities\" the main venue for party members' learning and education, a good platform for thought exchange, a practical course for deepening work styles, and a smelting furnace for tempering party nature. It has led branch party members to not forget their original aspirations, keep their missions in mind, and demonstrate new achievements and make new contributions in the new era and new relay.\n",
      "\n",
      "While doing well in \"prescribed movements,\" the branch has paid attention to combining dry indoctrination with flexible educational methods, making efforts in organization and activities. They have flexibly used \"online and offline\" and \"indoor and outdoor\" activity models to carry out \"theme party day+\" activities, combining \"sitting down\" with \"going out,\" promoting \"shared meetings\" and \"group discussions,\" and using popular forms to make theme party day activities more appealing. The branch's shared classrooms for theme party day activities, such as \"poetry appreciation,\" \"recommended books,\" and \"skill training,\" have benefited party members greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past three years, the branch has closely combined theme party day activities with their primary responsibilities, focusing on survey businesses, public welfare research, statistical news propaganda, pandemic prevention and control, and other key work. They have practiced their principles in serving the people and society. Activities such as \"One Branch, One Fortress; One Party Member, One Flag; Unite to Win the Pandemic Prevention and Control Battle\" and \"Civilized Conduct, New Winds; National Survey Pioneers in Action\" volunteer services have enhanced party members' political sense of honor and mission responsibility through practical services to the people and society. Every September, the branch combines \"China Statistics Open Day\" with community-building activities, conducting \"Statistics Promotion into the Community\" and \"Survey Services into the Community\" theme party day activities. They have also actively joined forces with county-level teams to organize activities like \"Go to the Grassroots, Understand Public Sentiment, and Promote Improvement\" and \"Learn Party History, Understand Local Conditions, Go to the Grassroots, and Provide Training,\" achieving the goal of \"seeking consensus through open statistics, finding problems through in-depth investigations, and doing real things for the people.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Reporter Duan Chuting and Zhao Yi report from Shenzhen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This TV model will be discontinued in a couple of days, so buying it now is a great deal. I just want to boost my sales.\" Recently, a reporter from *China Business Journal* visited a home appliance store in Shenzhen, where a sales representative enthusiastically introduced recent promotional activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coinciding with the off-season for home appliance sales, there were more sales staff than customers browsing products, creating a rather quiet atmosphere. Focusing on TVs, in February 2022, China's TV retail sales decreased year-on-year, with offline average prices falling for three consecutive months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the decline in TV prices is the downward trend in upstream liquid crystal TV panel (hereinafter referred to as \"TV panels\" or \"panels\") prices. Since the third quarter of 2021, TV panels have ended their price increase cycle, shifting from a supply shortage to a surplus, leading to continuous price declines.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a consumer perspective, the drop in TV average prices is expected to stimulate consumption. Some analysts even predict that the upcoming June 18 shopping festival will be another intense price war. However, for TV manufacturers, low-price competition is not the primary focus; winning the \"value war\" is crucial to protecting profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Shifting Supply-Demand Dynamics for Panels**\n",
      "\n",
      "From the third quarter of this year until the end of the year, a recovery in the global TV market is anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, China's TV industry, having entered a mature market, faced significant challenges. According to data from Ovum Cloudnet, China's TV market retail volume fell below 40 million units in 2021, reaching 38.35 million, the lowest level since 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "For TV manufacturers, under dual pressure on scale and profits, China's TV retail sales reached 128.9 billion yuan in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 6.6%. While retail volumes decreased, retail sales grew, indicating factors such as rising raw material prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omdia, an international information and communication technology research institution, analyzed that the shift to home-based lifestyles driven by the COVID-19 pandemic led to record growth in demand, prices, and revenue for large-size flat panel displays (FPDs) from the third quarter of 2020. In the first half of 2021, this high demand continued in the market, with even prices inflating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in panel prices also brought substantial profits to panel manufacturers. Referring to the recent 2021 annual performance report released by TCL Technology Group Corporation (000100.SZ), TCL, whose core business is semiconductor display technology through its subsidiary TCL HuaStar Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., saw a significant increase in total operating revenue of 112.8% year-on-year to 163.528 billion yuan, with net profit attributable to the parent company growing 129.3% to 10.062 billion yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the performance report, TCL stated that its semiconductor display business achieved significant year-on-year growth in shipment area, average prices of major products, and product profitability, with optimized business combinations and client structures further enhancing product revenue contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, benefiting from capacity expansion, the implementation of high-end strategies for large-size products, rapid breakthroughs in medium-size products and clients, and a focus on differentiation in small-size products, TCL's semiconductor display business saw a year-on-year increase in net profit of approximately 340%.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, starting from the third quarter of 2021, changes occurred in TV panel demand and prices. Rong Chaoping, a senior research manager at Ovum Cloudnet, informed the reporter that globally, TV shipments, after four consecutive quarters of growth, experienced a significant decline in the third quarter of 2021 as the \"stay-at-home economy\" effect cooled down. The decline in TV demand, coupled with various issues like port congestion, led to a rapid shift in the supply-demand relationship for TV panels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xie Qinyi, a senior research director at Omdia's display division, also analyzed for the reporter that the second half of 2021 was the period of most severe oversupply of TV panels, primarily due to a significant drop in demand for TV sets after the pandemic eased, causing a decline in both demand and prices for TV panels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Relatively speaking, in the first quarter of 2022, the decline in TV panel prices slowed down. The main reason is that the supply-demand relationship tended towards balance, and some LCD TV brands and contract manufacturers, seeing panel prices fall to a certain level, increased their panel purchases, providing some support to prices,\" Xie further explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the decline in TV panel prices, there was also a decrease in average prices at the TV retail end. According to data released by Ovum Cloudnet, from December 2021 to February 2022, the average price of China's TV industry in the offline market decreased from 5,837 yuan to 4,957 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Hui, General Manager of Ovum Cloudnet, predicted that, based on current trends, China's TV market average price is expected to further decline. \"The upcoming June 18 shopping festival is anticipated to be another intense price war.\" Besides the potential \"price war,\" Chen also mentioned that, given the current situation, upstream continuous price drops still pose challenges for TV brands in managing inventory and preventing price erosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xie, on the other hand, analyzed for the reporter that, based on the supply-demand relationship for panels, the current situation is a mild oversupply, with supply-demand balance expected in the second quarter and a shift towards supply-demand tightness starting in the third quarter. He also forecasted that from the third quarter onwards, a recovery in the global TV market is anticipated, with shopping festivals in China and holidays in Europe and North America expected to boost demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "As TV panel prices fluctuate in 2022, will this impact the profitability of panel manufacturers? Xie informed the reporter, \"Even if panel prices rebound in the second half of this year, the increase will not match the surge seen in 2021. Moreover, some panel sizes have already reached the cost margin, with sales even below cost, resulting in losses. Therefore, panel manufacturers' profitability this year may not be as robust as in 2021.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Navigating the \"Red Sea Market\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "TV manufacturers are shifting from price-based competition to value-based competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, the rise in raw material prices, including TV panels, led to an increase in TV unit prices, indirectly halting the industry's competition centered on low prices and high volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chen Hui's view, under the dual pressure of costs and growth in 2021, China's TV manufacturers shifted their strategic focus from market expansion to structural upgrading. \"TV manufacturers are moving away from price-based competition and towards value-based competition, with product value increasing and high-end market share growing steadily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen predicts that in 2022, China's TV industry is expected to make breakthroughs in areas like product innovation, scene development, and value enhancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Referring to a report released by Ovum Cloudnet, in the offline TV market of February 2022, 65-inch and 75-inch TVs accounted for 29.5% and 20.9% of retail sales, respectively, ranking first and second among various sizes. In contrast, in the same period of 2021, 65-inch and 55-inch TVs held the top positions. This indicates the strong growth of 75-inch TVs in the offline market and an upgrade in product structure towards larger screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining market trends with corporate practices, TV manufacturers have recently launched high-end and large-screen products, initiating the \"value war.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Skyworth Group Limited (00751.HK) stated in its recently released 2021 financial report that to address the issue of diminishing market growth in China, the company adjusted its sales strategy, shifting its focus to high-end TV products like OLED.\n",
      "\n",
      "The financial report showed that Skyworth increased its overall sales revenue by raising the average sales price through the growth of OLED and other high-end TV product sales. In 2021, Skyworth launched products such as 8K OLED TVs, the world's first curved and straight OLED TV, and 0.86 high color accuracy OLED TVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the TCL Spring New Product Launch held in early March, TCL released its third-generation QD-MiniLED technology and a series of new TV models, demonstrating its Mini LED and ultra-large screen strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a recent visit to a home appliance store, a TV sales representative mentioned, \"The current trend is to buy big, not small.\" Observing the exhibits from brands like TCL, Skyworth, Konka, and Samsung, products with 65-inch and 75-inch screens dominated, with some brands even showcasing 98-inch ultra-large screen products, whose prices ranged from over 5,000 yuan to tens of thousands of yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the sales representative, high-end products have had a positive impact on offline consumption. \"If the budget is within 3,000 yuan, consumers may directly place orders online without specifically visiting stores. On the other hand, those buying mid-to-high-end products often have higher requirements for picture quality and prefer to select and compare products in offline stores.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the reporter noticed that some TV brands offer their mid-to-high-end products at more competitive prices and with more attractive discounts on offline shopping platforms than online.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sales representative also explained, \"In online sales, discounts usually favor low-end products, while mid-to-high-end products often have better deals in offline channels. Moreover, when we sell a certain number of mid-to-high-end products in offline channels, we receive rebates from the brand, allowing us to offer better discounts to consumers.\"\n",

      "2.8 **Case Name:** Heating System Pipeline Leakage Alarm\n",
      "**Applicant Company:** Xi'an Ziwei Property Management Co., Ltd.\n",
      "**Investment Cost:** Over 200 RMB / Piece\n",
      "**Problem Solved:** Effectively eliminates the situation of untimely discovery of heating system leaks, improves maintenance timeliness, ensures good heating effects, saves costs, and reduces waste.\n",
      "**Case Description:** The automatic water supplement time of a normally operating heating system has a certain rhythm. However, when a leak occurs in the initial stage of the pipeline, the water supplement time and frequency become relatively frequent. The operation noise of the main circulation pump and heat exchanger covers up the running sound of the water supplement pump, making it difficult to detect abnormal conditions. Based on this characteristic, a water supplement time alarm device was added, setting the time of the time relay to a slightly larger value than the normal water supplement time of the system. When a leak occurs, the water supplement time will be extended, and when it exceeds the set time, the bell will sound an alarm.\n",

      "2.9 **Case Name:** Escalator Pulley Group Retrofit\n",
      "**Applicant Company:** Nanjing Jinying International Property Group Co., Ltd.\n",
      "**Investment Cost:** 7540 RMB / Batch\n",
      "**Problem Solved:** The replacement rate of damaged escalator pulley groups is high. The original design of the escalator pulley is a set of 6 bearings, fixed with rivets. When one bearing fails while the other 5 bearings and the bracket are in good condition, maintenance requires excessive man-hours, and the labor cost even exceeds the cost of replacement, often leading to the choice of complete replacement.\n",
      "**Case Description:** After repeatedly disassembling and assembling the pulley group, there was found to be room for optimization, namely, using 3D printing technology to make a composite bracket combined with 6201 bearings and nuts for fixing. When a bearing fails, it can be replaced individually. After nearly two months of testing, this method was proven feasible. The cost of manufacturing a new pulley group is approximately 58 RMB, while purchasing a set costs 273 RMB (maintenance unit price). The retrofit of the pulley group not only saves costs but also greatly reduces maintenance time.\n",

In particular, the provincial Health and Family Planning Commission and the Finance Department had addressed the village's difficulties head-on, improving the medical and living conditions of the leprosy patients, and significantly raising the quality of life for those living in the village and those with disabilities who had recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journalists observed that the leprosy village's appearance had been completely renewed. The newly painted walls displayed paintings and texts related to leprosy. The renovated wards were clean and tidy. Those patients capable of independent living had single rooms, while those requiring companionship shared rooms. The leprosy patients were fully supported by the state, and the monthly living allowance provided by the civil affairs system for each person had increased to over 800 yuan.\n",
