Once epidemic prevention requirements are met, personnel are allowed to enter the site promptly. Projects arrange in advance procurement channels for materials both within and outside the province, reasonably plan material transportation routes, and organize materials and supplies in batches to ensure timely delivery to meet on-site construction needs.\n",

      "Additionally, each project optimizes construction organization and arrangements, deeply taps the existing on-site resource potential, accelerates the entry efficiency of new personnel and machinery and equipment, and adopts measures such as \"resting workers without stopping machinery,\" striving to achieve a greater volume of physical work in a short period. Safety inspections of machinery and equipment, as well as checks for electricity use and fire prevention, are strengthened. Risk and hazard inspections are enhanced in tunnel excavation, key bridges, and sections with high fill and deep excavation to promptly address safety production gaps and strictly prevent all types of accidents.\n",

      "Last night, my husband was installing a newly bought small cabinet in the kitchen, and I was helping him. Sometimes he needed a screwdriver, sometimes a wrench, making me run back and forth like a revolving lantern, always having to rummage through the toolbox on the balcony for him. Later, finding it too troublesome, I simply spread the toolbox out and placed it by the kitchen door so he could fetch the tools himself. Our little cat, having never seen this scene before, ran over and kept crawling in and out of the toolbox, playing quite happily. Every time my husband took a tool, he first had to pick up the cat and move it aside. He also didn’t forget to stroke the cat’s head and tease it.\n",

      "Our daughter was originally sitting by the kitchen door watching her dad install the cabinet, but after a while, she pouted and went aside to play on her phone. Seeing that she looked rather upset, I went over and patted her head, asking, “Why aren’t you watching the fun anymore? Did your dad say something to you?” Putting down her phone, she complained, “I was just curious and casually flipped through the toolbox, but he said I was causing trouble.” I comforted her, “Then let’s take a break. It seems like no one’s that eager to watch him anyway.” The daughter pointed angrily at the kitten and said, “But it crawled into the box, and Dad kept praising how cute it was. Why can’t I move it even a little bit?” I glanced at my husband, who was busy teasing the cat, then looked at the cat meowing, and finally at my daughter’s scowling face. In my heart, I thought, my child, based on my observation, this probably has nothing to do with touching the toolbox. Rather, it might be related to whether you can act cute or not. If not, you should try acting cute while flipping through your dad’s toolbox.\n",

      "Whether in theory or in practice, new quality productive forces represent an intellectual achievement capable of leveraging the overall situation, advancing the system, and determining the course of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping introduced the scientific concept of new quality productive forces during his inspection tour in Heilongjiang. He has since elaborated on it in various venues, especially providing a systematic exposition during a collective study session of the Central Political Bureau. Overall, the proposal of new quality productive forces is an innovation and development of Marxist theory on productive forces, the latest achievement in Xi Jinping’s economic thought, an innovative core concept in the political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a resonant call to action at the critical moment of advancing Chinese-style modernization. It also constitutes a strategic deployment for building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. Whether theoretically or practically, new quality productive forces serve as a conceptual breakthrough that can impact the overall picture, propel the system forward, and determine historical progress. To deepen our understanding of this concept, it is important to grasp it from several perspectives and entry points.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it should be understood from the classical Marxist political economy definition of productive forces. In classical Marxism, the three elements that make up productive forces are the laborer, the means of labor, and the object of labor. The historical development and dialectical unfolding of these three elements contain the developmental logic of new quality productive forces. From economic and technological development practices, we see that the object of labor is now connected with new materials and new energy, the means of labor with informatization, artificial intelligence, and advanced precision equipment, and the laborers with specialized talents and industrial teams suitable for the information and intelligent era. This can also be related to Lenin’s discussion on labor productivity. The comprehensive penetration of science and technology into the elements of productive forces and the improvement of labor productivity are natural extensions of innovation in productive force elements. Marx regarded the means of labor as the primary marker dividing historical epochs, contrasting, for example, the hand-operated grinding mill and the steam engine; in fact, both the object of labor and laborers bear the qualitative defining features of their times. Lenin saw labor productivity as the fundamental criterion for socialism’s victory over capitalism, effectively incorporating science and technology into the system of productive forces. This enlightens us that every era has its own new quality productive forces belonging to its time. Therefore, the concept of new quality productive forces is a universally significant one, fully incorporable into the Marxist political economy and theory of productive forces, bearing great theoretical importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it should be understood from the historical process of our Party’s theoretical innovation since reform and opening-up. In the broadest sense, productive forces theory is a theory of development. Since reform and opening-up, our Party has made a series of major innovative achievements in productive forces theory through arduous theoretical and practical exploration. On the new journey of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s proposal of the concept of new quality productive forces represents a major integration and synthesis of our Party’s theory of productive forces. Positioned within this continuous historical lineage, we can more profoundly appreciate the historical significance of the concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it should be understood from the perspective of the rapidly advancing technological revolution. The technological revolution and its profound transformations are the main theme of our times. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s proposal of new quality productive forces is a highly condensed and innovative development of historical experience, signifying that our Party’s understanding of the technological revolution and its laws has reached a new height. The emphasis on “new” is pivotal, and the focus on “quality” is key. Productive forces has a general theoretical connotation, while “new” and “quality” constitute the era’s proposition and special requirements. Together, they form an organic theoretical innovation encompassing the general demands of developing productive forces and the special demands of seizing opportunities from the technological revolution. This points out bottlenecks and shortcomings in our modernization efforts and clarifies the key focal points and pathways for solving these issues. This theoretical achievement of new quality productive forces enriches and perfects the value function of Chinese-style modernization. Through this, we deeply feel the power of the leader’s thought, the theoretical courage and sense of mission of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the concept’s era-relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, it should be understood in the context of great power competition and the global configuration of the China-US rivalry. Great power competition is a dynamic force interplay, with various forces maneuvering, ebbing and flowing, balancing and constraining one another, shaping the world order of an era. Among these, certain great power relationships hold decisive roles. Science and technology, especially high-tech, determine human destiny and the rise and fall of nations, making them truly “major national concerns” that cannot be ignored. After the founding of New China, for a period, the focus was on nuclear technology. We developed the “Two Bombs and One Satellite” on a foundation of extreme poverty and backwardness. Now the focus is on information technology, artificial intelligence, new materials, new energy, life sciences, and more. While we are catching up, there is still a long road ahead. Great power competition measures not only scale but also quality, not only total quantity but also structure, and not only the stock but also the increment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, it should be understood from the dialectical movement between productive forces and production relations. The contradiction between productive forces and production relations is a fundamental concept of Marxism on social dynamics. They are in everlasting dialectical motion. Reforming production relations to liberate and develop productive forces is the basic method of social transformation. Our revolutions, reforms, development promotion, and modernization advancement are a grand narrative. Over more than 40 years, we have changed the face of China, its people, the Chinese nation, and the world by relying on reform and opening-up—the key move determining contemporary China’s destiny. Cultivating and developing new quality productive forces similarly depends on this key move. Currently, there are many institutional and structural obstacles restricting talent cultivation, scientific and technological innovation, and the development of new quality productive forces. There are widespread complaints and urgent demands regarding talent training models, science and technology management systems, innovation environments, outcome evaluation systems, intellectual property rights protection, and openness in science and technology. The proposal of new quality productive forces provides a rare historical opportunity and practical entry point for addressing these problems, advancing reforms of higher quality, and reaching a higher level of openness. This embodies sophisticated leadership art and methodological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it should be understood from the new journey of building a modern socialist power and achieving the second centenary goal. The timely completion of the first centenary’s historic task has laid a solid foundation and created a new historical starting point for realizing the grand blueprint envisioned by the 20th National Congress. The concept of new quality productive forces provides a new logical starting point and theoretical support for this new journey. China has ranked as the world’s second-largest economy for many years; however, many industries remain at the middle and lower ends of the industrial chain, with gaps mostly in core competitiveness. Today’s international competition is a competition of science and technology and talent, essentially a competition of high-quality productive forces. Those with superior technology are strong; those with better quality prevail. The proposal of new quality productive forces sounds the charge for the march toward high-quality development.\n",

The Hebei cultural and tourism system successfully completed the support and enhancement of contracted hotels in the Zhangjiakou competition area, ensured accommodation during the event, and fulfilled the performances and cultural activities in the Zhangjiakou competition area undertaken by Hebei. They produced a large batch of exquisite Winter Olympic-themed artistic works and held a series of thematic activities showcasing the works, making significant contributions to culture and tourism. In April this year, the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism was honored as an outstanding collective contributing to the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, making all cultural and tourism workers in Hebei proud. In the post-Olympic era, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou sports cultural tourism belt is progressing rapidly, and the Olympic legacy is helping Hebei’s cultural and tourism development enter a new opportunity.\n",

Taihang Water Town lies west beside the scenic Yishui Lake, north adjacent to the World Cultural Heritage site Qingxi Mausoleum, and south connected to the Red Revolutionary Base Wolf Tooth Mountain. The first Hebei Tourism Industry Development Conference held in 2016 has propelled Yi County’s regional tourism onto the fast track.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that Hebei’s innovative Tourism Development Conference platform continuously enriches tourism product offerings, steadily improves the public tourism service system, promotes comprehensive leaps in industry quality and efficiency, and has become a vital engine for implementing the new development philosophy and accelerating the construction of a powerful tourism province, as well as an important platform for promoting comprehensive regional development. To date, Hebei has held six consecutive provincial-level tourism industry development conferences and more than 60 city-level tourism industry development conferences. It has launched a batch of all-region tourism boutique zones such as Scenic Avenue No. 1, Hutuo River Ecological Corridor, and the Beijing-Zhang Sports Cultural Tourism Belt, which have become popular “internet-famous” check-in spots highly recommended by netizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistics show that from 2016 to 2019, Hebei’s total tourism visits grew at an average annual rate of 19%, total tourism revenue grew at 26% annually, and total tourism investment grew at 32.6% annually—all among the top nationwide.

Public cultural service system construction in 55 counties (cities, districts) across the province has reached national or provincial demonstration standards. More than 100,000 cultural benefit performances have been held, benefiting over 100 million people.

      "There are many private Chinese medicine clinics in Hong Kong, where Chinese medicine practitioners have rich outpatient experience, but opportunities for hands-on practice in hospital wards are relatively limited. Lam Pui-yin, Vice President of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, pointed out that although there are nearly ten thousand Chinese medicine practitioners in Hong Kong, relatively few have served in the public healthcare system. Generally, they are not very familiar with the ward environment, methods of collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine, and clinical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chinese medicine practitioners with practical hospital experience are relatively rare in Hong Kong,\" Lam Pui-yin said. Although such professionals can be introduced from the Mainland as a temporary measure, in the long run, it is essential to cultivate local talent in this area. \"We should leverage the expertise of senior Chinese medicine practitioners from the Mainland to help train Hong Kong’s Chinese medicine practitioners. Training should not only impart knowledge and skills but also provide practice in appropriate environments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lam Pui-yin stated that the first step is to allow Chinese medicine practitioners to work and receive training in public hospital wards. \"If training relies solely on face-to-face sessions or textbooks, it cannot cultivate practitioners with practical experience. After all, healthcare is a clinical practice, and it is difficult to master solely by studying.\" She pointed out that there are currently three universities in Hong Kong offering full-time Bachelor’s degree programs in Chinese medicine. Students now must intern for several months at Chinese medicine hospitals in the Mainland to gain clinical experience. \"We hope that in the future, students can intern in wards of public hospitals under the Hospital Authority. Additionally, the curriculum should include content on how Chinese and Western medicine collaborate, as well as training on related examinations, to enrich the clinical experience of the new generation of Chinese medicine students.\"\n",

      "By handling cases, the Shouguang City Procuratorate in Shandong Province has achieved tangible results that directly benefit people’s livelihoods: recovering a residential special maintenance fund that had been dormant for ten years for homeowners, exposing the truth behind a fraudulent lawsuit involving millions in corporate goods payments, and cutting off a money laundering network concealed by “slow recharge discounts” on phone bills. These achievements have won heartfelt praise from the public. Chief Prosecutor Song Jiaode of the Procuratorate stated, “We will continue to use ‘procuratorial work for the people’ as our focus, centering on the urgent difficulties and concerns of the people, and safeguard their rights and interests with the power of the rule of law.”\n",

      "Breaking Through a Decade-Long Chronic Problem  \n",
      "In July 2022, frequent elevator malfunctions occurred in a residential community. After homeowners applied for repairs, the property management informed them that because the developer had not transferred the residential special maintenance fund to the housing construction department’s designated supervisory account, elevator repairs had to be paid for by the homeowners themselves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, ten years ago, when the 22 homeowners purchased their houses, they had already paid the residential special maintenance fund to the developer. Why were they now required to pay out of pocket for elevator repairs? The 22 homeowners, including Mr. Zhang, repeatedly communicated with the developer but to no avail, and the homeowners’ rights protection efforts reached a deadlock. Subsequently, Mr. Zhang and others came to the Shouguang City Procuratorate’s 12309 Procuratorial Service Center seeking help. Prosecutor Zhang Yongzhi who received the petition investigated the details and suggested that they could file a lawsuit in their personal names.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After the court ruled in favor of the homeowners, the developer delayed compliance with the judgment. The Shouguang City Procuratorate continuously followed up supervision and jointly worked with the court, housing construction, finance, and other departments to research solutions. Ultimately, the court took the developer’s previously deposited property quality guarantee funds held in the Finance Bureau’s account as the execution target, promptly transferring the funds to the residential special maintenance fund account of the housing construction department, supporting the parties’ claims and preventing escalation of the conflict.  \n",

      "Striking Down Fraudulent Lawsuits  \n",
      "In April 2023, the civil procuratorial department of the Shouguang City Procuratorate discovered a case clue during their duty performance, which led to uncovering a fraudulent lawsuit involving nearly one million yuan.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, a trading company signed a steel sale contract with a construction company, agreeing that the trading company would supply designated brand steel. During delivery, the construction company found that some steel brands did not match the contract and requested replacement. However, Yang, the head of the trading company, neither supplied the missing 53 tons of steel nor replaced them, but secretly colluded with the project manager Liu by forging false documents to inflate debts by 450,000 yuan and filed a lawsuit with the court in June 2022. The court’s first-instance judgment ordered the construction company to pay over 950,000 yuan, including payments for 53 tons of steel not actually delivered. Because the construction company did not appeal, the judgment became final and was enforced.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“This case seemed ordinary, but the submitted signing documents conflicted obviously with delivery records, especially the details that replacement was not completed yet claimed as fulfilled, which strongly indicated fraudulent litigation,” said prosecuting officer Cao Weidong.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecutor reviewed case files and interviewed key witnesses to verify delivery and signing details one by one, ultimately confirming that Yang had forged shipment receipt documents to increase the claimed amount and filed the lawsuit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Fraudulent litigation not only damages business interests but also erodes judicial credibility. Yang’s actions constituted fraudulent litigation, causing errors in the factual findings of the judgment, harming legitimate corporate rights and disrupting judicial order. Therefore, on May 5, 2023, the Procuratorate filed a protest with the Weifang City Procuratorate. On August 2, the Weifang Procuratorate submitted the protest to the Weifang Intermediate People’s Court. On November 24, the court ordered a retrial by the Shouguang City Court. On July 12, 2024, the Shouguang City Court issued a retrial verdict reducing the original amount by nearly 400,000 yuan.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Yang and the trading company’s fraudulent litigation behavior, the Procuratorate simultaneously submitted a procuratorial recommendation to the court. Ultimately, the trading company was fined 100,000 yuan, and Yang was sentenced to fifteen days of judicial detention, effectively deterring dishonest litigation conduct.\n",

      "Cutting Off the Black Money Chain  \n",
      "“Enjoy 30% off on phone and electricity bill recharges…” Such seemingly favorable “slow recharge discounts” may actually be a tool criminals use to “launder” illicit funds.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, while handling a case related to concealing and disguising criminal proceeds, prosecutors at the Shouguang City Procuratorate uncovered that a criminal gang had set up a “slow recharge platform” which attracted consumers with low-price recharges orders, then fractionally recharged proceeds from telecom fraud, online gambling, and other illegal sources into user accounts, ultimately transferring the illicit money through virtual currencies and completing the full cycle of “black money turning white.”  \n",

      "Facing challenges such as anonymous operations and dispersed funds flows, the Procuratorate relied on big data for source tracing and jointly formed a special task force with public security and financial regulatory authorities.

      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City is located in the southern part of Nanchang County, Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, with a total planned area of 33.82 square kilometers. It is a key direction for open economic development at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. In recent years, Nanchang City has earnestly implemented the new development philosophy, actively integrated into the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, seized the development opportunities brought by the State Council's approval to establish the Jiangxi Inland Open Economy Pilot Zone, closely followed the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's new requirements for comprehensively expanding openness, and fully leveraged Xiangtang Town in Nanchang County’s excellent railway resources and location advantages. Efforts have been made to build Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City into a \"national inland open experimental demonstration zone, Jiangxi’s ‘Three Identicals’ experimental development innovation zone, and the Greater Nanchang Metropolitan Area railway logistics cluster,\" showcasing Nanchang’s commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unique Location Advantage\n",
      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City possesses a premier railway marshalling yard—Xiangtang West Freight Marshalling Station. This station is a bidirectional mixed-type level-three yard with seven subdivisions, consisting of two major systems: the upbound (secondary level with four subdivisions) and downbound (tertiary level with three subdivisions), featuring a total of 139 tracks. Currently, Xiangtang West station handles an average daily disassembly of over 17,000 freight trains. Major railways such as the Jingjiu (Beijing-Kowloon), Hukun (Shanghai-Kunming), Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Xiangpu lines converge here. National highways 105, 316, and 320 pass through the area, and expressways including Hukun, Ganyue, Fuyin, and Changning provide fast connections, forming a multi-dimensional, interconnected transportation network. About 70% of goods from southern Jiangxi enter Nanchang via Xiangtang and are then distributed nationwide, making it a significant logistics hub and cargo distribution center for Jiangxi Province and the central region of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grand and Open Planning Concept\n",
      "Jiangxi Province clearly proposes accelerating the construction of Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, it plans to establish “three major sectors and sixteen functional zones” (including the high-end services sector, advanced manufacturing sector, and modern logistics sector; railway port, railway logistics base, commodity vehicle logistics zone, comprehensive bonded zone, port logistics zone, cold chain logistics zone, e-commerce logistics zone, express delivery and city distribution zone, highway freight zone, commerce and warehousing distribution zone, strategic reserved zone, technology innovation headquarters base, international trade exhibition corridor, healthy leisure waterfront, high-quality talent living circle, and port-adjacent manufacturing park). A developmental layout consisting of \"one core gathering energy, one corridor leading, one vein connecting cities, and coordinated industry-city development\" has been formed—where the core represents the smart brain; the corridor refers to the urban corridor stretching north-south along the commercial office area; and the vein is the watercourse of the Lianxi River.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clustered Logistics Industry\n",
      "The Xiangtang Railway Logistics Base has been approved as a national first-class railway logistics base and the logistics center of Jiangxi Province, establishing a commodity vehicle transportation logistics base with an annual capacity of over 200,000 units. Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City has attracted more than 20 branded logistics enterprises, with warehouse space exceeding 500,000 square meters. Enterprises such as JD Logistics, Suning Logistics, Cainiao Network, Transfar Logistics, and China Merchants Logistics have settled here, making it one of the most concentrated logistics parks in Jiangxi’s logistics industry. By focusing on \"optimizing premium trains\" and \"launching new trains,\" currently eight international freight train routes have been opened (from Nanchang Xiangtang to Rotterdam in the Netherlands; Hanoi, Vietnam; Moscow, Russia; Minsk and Orsha in Belarus; Paris, France; Kyiv, Ukraine; and Poland), along with five rail-sea combined foreign trade train routes (from Nanchang Xiangtang to Yantian Port in Shenzhen, Beilun Port in Ningbo, Jiangyin Port in Fujian, Gaoqi Port in Xiamen, and Shanghai Port). In 2020, 767 foreign trade trains were operated, handling 46,372 TEUs of import and export cargo, with increases of 17.28% and 44.17% respectively, providing a low-cost and convenient major channel for Jiangxi’s quality products to go abroad and reach the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry-Education Integrated Talent Base\n",
      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City hosts six colleges: Jiangxi Garment Institute, Jiangxi Vocational and Technical College of Commerce and Industry, Jiangxi Vocational and Technical College of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Aviation Vocational and Technical College, Jiangxi Pharmaceutical School, and Nanchang Xiangyuan Rail Technology School. Together, these institutions serve over 50,000 students and faculty. They offer programs in logistics management, e-commerce, fashion design, aircraft manufacturing and maintenance, pharmaceutical logistics, railway transportation management, and more. The new city actively explores and refines an innovative talent cultivation model through school-enterprise cooperation, having already delivered tens of thousands of specialized talents to Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City. Long-term “order-based” education and employment cooperation relationships have been established with enterprises that have invested in the new city, carrying out ordered training and jointly building university internship bases, student entrepreneurship incubation bases, and modern logistics industry-university-research training bases. Through cooperation among government, schools, and enterprises, resources and factors on all sides are activated, forming a strategic think tank for industrial development and achieving a win-win situation in technology services, achievement transformation, and talent cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost Reduction and Efficiency Enhancement “Three Identicals” Policy\n",
      "Based on the innovation of Nanchang’s rail-sea combined transport, the “Three Identicals” pilot program is underway. This involves providing enterprises with full railway freight subsidies, subsidies for collection and distribution fees between origin/destination stations and yards, and smart port construction, gradually realizing “import freight prices equal to those at coastal ports, export freight prices equal to those at coastal ports, and customs clearance efficiency equal to that at coastal ports.” This accelerates the aggregation of foreign trade import and export goods from surrounding areas into Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City, further lowering logistics costs for export-oriented companies, promoting open economic development, completing the logistics upstream and downstream industrial chain, and growing the port economy zone stronger and better. Additionally, a fund turnover pool has been set up, with 100 million yuan allocated annually for advance payments related to the “Three Identicals” policy and export tax rebates. Fully leveraging the international freight fast channel from Nanchang Xiangtang to coastal ports, Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City is being built into a \"direct route\" to international markets and an “accelerator” for outbound economic development, boosting the construction of Jiangxi’s inland open economy pilot zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City is an important platform for Nanchang’s opening to the outside world. Xiangtang Town will further enhance quality in “bringing in” resources, improve the “going out” system, focus on constructing a modern logistics system, develop new economies, new business forms, and new models, adhere to the “Four Precision” requirements, benchmark against developed coastal areas, and strengthen the construction, operation, and management of the international inland port. This will effectively showcase Nanchang’s good external image, become the core carrier area serving Jiangxi’s inland open economy pilot zone, a hub economic demonstration zone integrating “port, industry, city, and people,” and a strategic foothold and new development highland for Jiangxi Province’s participation in building the new development pattern.\n",

      "The meeting emphasized the need to deeply learn the lessons from the “8.21” mountain flood disaster in Jinyang, resolutely fight the tough battle against this round of heavy rainfall and the autumn rains in western China for disaster prevention and mitigation. All localities and departments should seriously reflect and analyze, draw lessons to identify issues by analogy, and truly sound the alarm from deep within their minds and tighten their preparations. The focus should be on solidly and thoroughly implementing the work of “prevention.” Mountain flood and geological disaster prevention should be prioritized, with resolute implementation of the province-wide special actions for disaster prevention, mitigation, and avoidance. A comprehensive investigation and rectification of safety risks and hidden dangers at all flood-related construction sites and camps in mountainous areas must be carried out, and a new round of comprehensive geological disaster inspections should be promptly launched. Responsibilities for disaster prevention and mitigation safety must be continuously pushed downwards, reaching the smallest units, every position, and each employee. Under no circumstances should situations arise where responsibilities are “unmanageable, poorly managed, unmanaged, difficult to manage, or no one dares to manage.”\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the latest report from The Times of Israel, on the 20th, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) detected a new round of ballistic missile launches from Iran. Reports indicate that this missile barrage triggered air defense alarms across the entire territory of Israel, with multiple loud explosions reported in the southern Beersheba region and Tel Aviv. According to Israeli media outlet YNET, Iran launched approximately 20 missiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israeli military has reminded civilians in areas where alarms are sounding to enter bomb shelters and remain there until further notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, the IDF stated that the Israeli Air Force is conducting a new round of strikes against targets in western and central Iran. On the 20th, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz stated that he has instructed the IDF to \"intensify strikes against Iranian targets\" to \"undermine the stability of the Iranian regime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During a situation assessment on the morning of the 20th with IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi and other senior military officers, Gantz said that Israel must reinforce its military operations to compel Iran to \"massively evacuate populations from Tehran, thereby destabilizing its regime and enhancing deterrence against Iran. At the same time, the IDF should continue strikes against Iranian facilities and scientists to halt its nuclear program until all operational objectives are fully achieved.\"\n",

      "As one of the first batch of pioneering units for Party-building-led innovation and quality excellence in primary and secondary schools in Chongqing in the new era, Zhuhai Experimental Primary School in Wuxi County, Chongqing, unswervingly strengthens the comprehensive leadership of the Party over education work. Drawing momentum from the Red Rock Spirit, it activates intrinsic motivation through four major reforms, striving to build a learning-oriented, service-oriented, innovative, and efficient grassroots Party organization. The school accelerates the construction of the “Red Rock Vanguard” reformative organization in the new era and aims to create a distinctive and renowned school with Wuxi characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transforming Ideological Concepts to Strengthen Political Responsibility  \n",
      "Ideology leads action. Zhuhai Experimental Primary School always adheres to the principle of “leading a major change in concepts through great ideological emancipation,” firmly shoulders political responsibility, and stimulates the intrinsic drive within the Party organization for reform, tackling difficulties, and taking on responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhancing Theoretical Learning. The school carefully plans theme education, implementing learning content through various forms such as special lectures, forums and salons, online dissemination, and micro-Party classes, thereby strengthening all Party members’ understanding and recognition of comprehensive and strict Party governance and stringent political discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhancing Practical Learning. Focusing on themes such as integration evaluation standards of “five educations,” research on quality assurance systems for quality education, and school-home-community collaborative education methods, the school transforms “problem lists” into “reform lists” and then into “achievement lists” through practice, promoting high-quality development of school education and teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhancing Political Learning. Centering on responsibility and mission, the school motivates Party members to combine their personal aspirations with the “Two Centenary Goals,” courageously shoulder heavy tasks, work diligently and pragmatically, and strive to be pioneers, trailblazers, and contributors leading the times.\n",

      "Transforming Organizational Systems to Build a Strong Political Fortress  \n",
      "Zhuhai Experimental Primary School focuses on reforming its organizational system, striving to build a rigorous organizational structure with effective implementation that connects all levels, ensuring that every decision and deployment quickly reaches every corner of the campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a Development Community Based on the “Party-building Alliance.” As the inaugural leader of the Zhuhai Experimental Primary School Party-building Alliance, the school prioritizes enhancing connotations, conducting one-to-one matches based on each school’s “resource lists” and “need lists,” achieving resource sharing, joint student nurturing, co-linked Party-building, and shared development through diligent cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leveraging the “One Building Four Leads” Model to Stimulate New Vitality in School Operations. The school fully utilizes the exemplary role of Party members by establishing Party groups within each subject research group. Through the approach of “Party-building leading team-building, trade union-building, scientific research-building, and club-building,” it achieves Party leadership coverage across all subjects, grades, and departments, promoting coordinated deployment, advancement, and implementation of Party-building and education and teaching.\n",

The school grasps integration points, accurately identifies entry points, and focuses efforts to actively reform Party-building work modes, striving to convert Party-building achievements into school development vitality and competitive strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standardizing the “Commitment Letter” Signing Process. Focusing on key and difficult tasks, the Party branch secretary signs a “Performance Commitment Letter” annually with Wuxi County government departments, and teachers conduct “transparent public promises” at the beginning of each semester, making open commitments from both positive and negative aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimizing the “One Body, Two Wings, Three Guides, Four Lines” Governance Model. Centered on the new development concept, the school takes the integration of teaching and research as the main body, two wings as specialties and projects, three guides as moral education, safety, and logistics, and four governance lines as administration, weekly duty, lesson preparation and research groups, and grade groups. This gradually forms a “One Body, Two Wings, Three Guides, Four Lines” governance model where powers and responsibilities are matched, and collaboration is efficient, ensuring work is implemented effectively and yields real results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating the “1+4” Party-building Brand. Following the overall deployment of the Chongqing education authorities’ “Two Creations,” the school leverages Wuxi’s “humanities” and “ecological” advantages to build the “1+4” Party-building brand: “1” represents Party-building leading the school’s comprehensive development; “4” refers to core areas including “Party-building + teacher ethics,” “Party-building + teaching and research,” “Party-building + mass organizations,” and “Party-building + clubs.” The school integrates “kindness and beauty” into cultural construction and focuses on shaping the cultural brand of “Humanistic Experimental Primary School · Education of Kindness and Beauty,” aiming to create a distinctive school featuring “humanity, kindness, and beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Transforming Service Approaches to Consolidate Organizational Synergy  \n",
      "Under the new circumstances, strengthening the construction of service-oriented Party organizations has increasingly become a key direction in school Party-building work. Zhuhai Experimental Primary School requires its Party organization to carry a strong sense of responsibility and mission, enhance service functions, improve service efficiency, and better meet the diverse needs of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building Strong Service Platforms. The school innovatively establishes a Party member activity center, featuring a book bar, tea bar, “Party Members’ Books Corner,” and “Party-Building Work Bulletin Board,” fostering close relations between Party and masses and enhancing organizational cohesion. It establishes school-level master teacher studios in Chinese, mathematics, art, and information technology to cultivate groups of master teachers step by step. It also builds a homework tutoring station for left-behind children and sets up the “Experimental Primary School Soul Station” psychological counseling center, allowing students to feel warmth and care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forging Service Teams. The school implements the teachers' “Four Name” project, strictly carrying out five key projects including the “Green-Blue Project,” Master Teacher Program, exemplary lesson demonstrations, experience sharing, and expert guidance, promoting the upgrading of the teaching workforce. It forms the “Red Rock Volunteer Service Team” to participate in volunteer service activities, encourages urban and rural grassroots Party organizations to engage in paired co-construction activities, and draws the “concentric circles” of shared governance, joint construction, and common sharing.\n",
      "\n",

      "On the morning of November 4, 2024, the National Healthcare Security Administration held a Party Leadership Group meeting to convey and study General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech and the spirit of the special seminar for provincial- and ministerial-level senior cadres on studying and implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhang Ke, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Administration and Director of the Bureau, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. He emphasized the need to fully and faithfully implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech, implement the reform decisions and deployments of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Central Committee, uphold a people-centered approach, comprehensively fulfill reform tasks, strengthen confidence in reform, accurately grasp the direction of reform, reinforce reform responsibilities, and pool collective reform efforts. The meeting called for advancing healthcare security reform with steady and swift progress to vigorously resolve the medical treatment and disease-related concerns of all the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting pointed out that General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech at the opening ceremony profoundly elaborated on a series of major theoretical and practical issues concerning further deepening reform comprehensively. It put forward a series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new judgments. The speech was lofty in purpose, profound in thought, rich in connotation, and highly political, theoretical, targeted, and instructive. General Secretary Xi’s important speech is of great significance for us to fully and accurately understand the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Central Committee, deeply grasp the guiding ideology, overall goals, major principles, and scientific methods of further comprehensive deepening of reform, promote steady and far-reaching reform on the new journey, and ensure precise implementation and effectiveness of various reform measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting stressed that the National Healthcare Security Administration must profoundly understand and grasp the rich connotations, essential meanings, and practical requirements of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech. It must deeply recognize and grasp the major principles of reform. General Secretary Xi’s important speech emphasizes the crucial principle that reform must firmly grasp and always adhere to “staying true to the original aspiration and innovating.” The Administration must uphold the Party’s comprehensive leadership, adhere to Marxism, uphold socialism with Chinese characteristics, and uphold the people’s democratic dictatorship. Starting from and returning to promoting social fairness and justice and enhancing people’s well-being, it must firmly believe that reforms have clear directions and principles — resolutely reform what must be reformed, and not reform what should not be reformed. It must deeply understand and grasp the scientific methods of reform. General Secretary Xi’s important speech clearly states that reform is a systemic project that requires scientific methods and good handling of various relationships. The Administration must adhere to guiding and advancing reform with scientific methods, master and apply the scientific methodology of reform well, consistently focus on key points while promoting comprehensively, unify reform with the rule of law, maintain the dialectical unity of demolition and establishment, unify reform and opening-up, properly handle the relationship between deployment and implementation, and persistently ensure reform is implemented and carried out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting noted that Party organizations at all levels within the Administration and the broad ranks of Party members and cadres must conscientiously study and comprehend the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech, and spare no effort to implement the reform arrangements in the healthcare security field set by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Central Committee. Reform should follow new trends of the times, new practical development requirements, and new expectations of the people. It should protect the “small,” by giving preferential guarantees for pediatric and children’s medication policies, speeding up the docking and implementation of price items such as neonatal care and labor analgesia, promoting the improvement and optimization of pediatric and obstetric services, studying and improving the maternity insurance system, and further strengthening maternity support and protection functions; care for the “elderly,” actively promoting the establishment of long-term care insurance systems, optimizing care-free service, and preparing well for the challenges of an aging society; protect the “sick,” expand the scope of family mutual aid within individual accounts of employee medical insurance, orderly expand cross-province direct settlement for outpatient chronic and special diseases, and provide more convenient services for outpatients with chronic and special diseases; support the “new,” by allowing more new and effective medicines to enter the medical insurance catalog; and combat the “fake,” by comprehensively cracking down on insurance fraud, safeguarding the medical treatment and life-saving funds of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting emphasized the need to create a favorable atmosphere for reform, focusing both on guiding reform-related public opinion and managing reform expectations, widely building consensus for reform, mobilizing all positive factors, promoting the main theme, transmitting positive energy, and forming a strong atmosphere of system-wide support, backing, and promotion of reform. It called for more closely uniting around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, firmly defending the “Two Establishes,” resolutely achieving the “Two Safeguards,” unifying thoughts and actions with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech and the plenary session’s deployments, uniting as one, pioneering and making persistent efforts, and contributing the healthcare security strength to further deepen reform comprehensively and advance modernization with Chinese characteristics.\n",

      "In Tongliao City, under the leadership and call of the Municipal Women’s Federation, a group of resolute women—who are both females and Party members—have been tirelessly working throughout the city’s banners, counties, districts, municipal units, sums, townships, and gachas. They share a common name: “Party Member Mothers.” They provide not only material assistance to children in difficult circumstances but also emotional care, motherly companionship, and warmth.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the initiating unit of the “Party Member Mothers” volunteer service, all 13 female Party members of the Tongliao Municipal Women’s Federation have joined the ranks, taking the lead by going deep into Kulun Banner, the Development Zone, and other areas to pair up with children in difficulty, exchanging “Love Contact Cards” and building strong emotional bonds. Among these activities, what left the deepest impression on Bao Hongmei, Chairwoman of the Municipal Women’s Federation, was the “Colorful Holiday Public Welfare Summer Care Class” held in the Shentie Riverside Garden Community. This program provided 25 children with a variety of engaging activities and attentive tutoring, allowing them to enjoy a joyful and unforgettable holiday. In her view, imparting wisdom and helping children grow is the most heartfelt declaration of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Party Member Mothers” volunteer service also pays special attention to the mental health of young children, especially those who are disabled, from divorced families, or single-parent families. They have organized outdoor psychological development activities, one-on-one counseling, sandplay therapy, and more, truly nurturing these children’s growth from the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, many law enforcement personnel from the Public Security Bureau, Procuratorate, and Courts have joined the ranks of the “Party Member Mothers.” The “Party Member Mothers” from the Youth Trial Studio of the Horqin Left Rear Banner People’s Court extend judicial services by regularly spreading legal knowledge to their paired children. Meanwhile, the policewomen “Party Member Mothers” from the Tongliao Public Security Bureau visit Hongxing Central Primary School, using graphic courseware, live Q&A sessions, and picture quizzes to educate children about drug prevention, further enhancing their ability to resist and prevent drug abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the “Party Member Mothers” volunteer service, the Tongliao Municipal Women’s Federation integrates the selection of “Civilized Families,” “Five-Good Families,” and “Most Beautiful Families” into its work, widely publicizing and promoting their touching stories in society. Using the traditional values, national character, and cultural ethos of respect for the elderly and care for the young, neighborhood solidarity, and frugality that have been formed by the Chinese nation since ancient times, they guide children to grow and succeed.\n",

      "The “Party Member Mothers” volunteer service makes full use of Tongliao’s red cultural resources and combines it with Party history education through visits to red bases, telling red stories, singing revolutionary songs, and watching red-themed films, conducting patriotism and revolutionary tradition education for children. Strengthening the consciousness of the Chinese national community is also an important part of the “Party Member Mothers” volunteer service. By sharing classic cases such as “Three Thousand Orphans Entering Inner Mongolia” and “Working Together to Build Baogang,” they sow seeds of ethnic unity in the hearts of children and integrate it into their blood.\n",
      "\n",

Archaeology not only addresses the profound question of \"Where do we come from, and where are we going?\" but also provides a contemporary answer to \"Why China.\"\n",

      "Completing the entire process for renewing a driver's license in just 10 minutes; handling newborn household registration at a single window; simplified procedures for ID card replacement; temporary ID cards available immediately upon application... Since the beginning of this year, the public security service windows in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, have fully moved into county-level government service centers. The number of police service windows in the city has been streamlined from the original 186 single-service windows to 138 comprehensive service windows. The number of full-time and part-time police officers and assistants at these windows has been optimized from 476 to 380. The number of public security services offered in government centers has increased from 32 to 133, with a public satisfaction rate exceeding 98%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lincang Public Security Bureau has vigorously promoted the relocation of police government service items into三级政务服务中心 (three-tier government service centers), striving to transform from a system of \"multiple windows for single police units\" to an \"integrated one-stop window\" approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lincang, the six-police integrated public security window — combining petition services, traffic police, anti-drug, public security, cyber security, and entry-exit administration — has moved into county (district) government service centers; at the township and town level, a three-police integrated public security service window combining petition services, traffic police, and public security has been established in convenience service centers. For towns or townships without conditions for relocation, police stations have integrated traffic police service windows to set up convenient public security service stations. Currently, comprehensive public security windows in eight counties (districts) have completely moved into county-level government service centers; 32 police stations have set up offices in township convenience centers; and eight police stations have integrated their traffic police squad business windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, following the principle of \"fast service at general windows, quality service at specialized windows,\" a dual-track \"generalist + specialist\" service model has been established. At county-level public security service windows, no less than 50% are comprehensive generalist windows with integrated reception, classified backend approval, and unified service delivery. \"One window now performs the functions of what used to take three or four windows,\" said an official.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the summer vacation, the public security comprehensive service windows at Lincang government service centers experienced a rush, handling on average 150 to 200 transactions per day on the spot, with peaks reaching over 300 cases.\n",

      "\"To provide high-quality and efficient services to the public, we need to understand the business of each police unit and learn on the job,\" said window police officer Chen Pin.

      "\n",
      "Committed to achieving public satisfaction, the Lincang Public Security Bureau continuously strengthens a sense of responsibility, regularly conducts business training, implements job rotation, and focuses on capacity support. Meanwhile, window departments have improved and enforced systems such as the first-contact responsibility system, service commitment system, time-limited processing system, and tolerance of incomplete documents system. They have compiled flowcharts for comprehensive window procedures and standardized service item guides and workflows.\n",

      "Yang Xianyi was an exceptionally gifted talent in the academic world, and his two younger sisters were also extraordinary. The eldest younger sister, Yang Minru, was an expert in classical Chinese literature, and the second sister, Yang Jingru (later renamed Yang Yi), was also a famous translator. They came from a literary family. Their father, Yang Yuzhang, received a traditional Chinese education in his early years and later studied abroad in Japan, majoring in economics at Waseda University. After returning to China, he became the first manager of the Bank of China in Tianjin. Through his own abilities, he amassed a fortune of one million yuan, but his only regret was having no offspring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife had eight pregnancies, but only two children survived, both girls. Yang Yuzhang then married a second wife. In 1915, the second wife gave birth to a son, Yang Xianyi. The birth of the son was a great joy for the Yang family. After his birth, Yang Xianyi was taken to live with the first wife and became the most beloved treasure of the family. Subsequently, the second wife gave birth to two more daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the son was five years old, Yang Yuzhang fell ill suddenly and unfortunately passed away at a young age. He left behind a substantial inheritance as well as three women and six children (plus a concubine and her daughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Yang Xianyi’s mother was only 24 years old. She was determined to raise her three children well and ensure they received a good education. She came from a humble background, a poor child in a rural family in Hebei, with little literacy and no money for schooling. She had been sold to the Yang family as a concubine. Young, pretty, and intelligent, she won Yang Yuzhang’s genuine love. Soon, she learned to read and write from her “master” (her way of referring to her husband). The couple had a deep affection and often read novels together. Through reading, she experienced happiness she had never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, their sweet days lasted only six or seven years before her husband suddenly left her. She was deeply grieved, but her three children were her greatest comfort. Because she bore the family’s only son, Yang Xianyi, she inherited tens of thousands of yuan worth of stocks. Their life was still relatively comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife was a wealthy young lady from a family of equal status to the Yangs. She had studied in a private school, and her biggest hobby was playing mahjong. She was kind and treated the two concubines and the illegitimate daughters fairly well. However, she believed in the saying “A woman’s virtue lies in lack of talent” and never cared about the education of her two daughters. Yang Xianyi’s mother, having personally experienced the benefits of reading, fought for her two daughters’ access to schooling. Once they reached school age, the two girls successively enrolled in the American missionary school, Zhongxi Girls' School, which was the best girls' school in Tianjin at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the only boy in this wealthy family, Yang Xianyi was born the \"little emperor\" of the household. He lived a life of luxury and displayed intelligence and mischief from a very young age. He once poured a bottle of his father’s French brandy into the goldfish tank and found great amusement watching the \"drunken fish\" tumbling inside the tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife sincerely hoped the beloved son would grow up smoothly, and she placed him and the girls in order — she thought girls' lives were \"cheap\" and easier to raise. The eldest and second sisters were daughters of the first wife; Yang Xianyi was ranked third; the concubine’s daughter was fourth; Yang Minru and Yang Jingru were fifth and sixth, respectively. Thus, the children of the uncles often teased Yang Xianyi by calling him \"Miss Yang the Third.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the \"apple of the family’s eye.\" His sister Yang Minru still recalled: \"His toys were unlike ordinary ones. One toy we played with even as we grew up was what’s now called a music box. Inside, it tinkled with the sound of several men and women dancing, all dressed in the style of France’s Louis XIV era. That music box was very valuable. That was his thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the little master was seven, the first wife worried about kidnapping and for safety hired Mr. Wei Ruzhou, a former Qing scholar, to come to the home and teach. Yang Xianyi began reading “Three Character Classic,” “Hundred Family Surnames,” then the Four Books and Five Classics, “Selections of Ancient Prose,” Tang poetry and Song lyrics, laying a solid foundation in Chinese classical studies. Though he was not diligent, he always received praise from Master Wei. During this period, he also read many miscellaneous books.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until Yang Xianyi was 13 that the first wife allowed him to attend middle school at the missionary school Xin Xue Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "At school, Yang Xianyi still did not study hard and spent more time playing. The class always had a top student who studied hard, and Yang Xianyi said: “I won’t compete with him, so I always get second place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi often pulled pranks. Once, during an algebra test, some classmates couldn’t solve certain problems. He passed written answers on slips of paper to them and even stuck one on the back of the teacher’s clothes. The teacher patrolled the classroom, and everyone saw the answers... Later, when the teacher discovered him, he admitted it outright. Instead of punishing him, the teacher praised his honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Master Wei left the Yang family due to old age and infirmity, the mother hired a new tutor to teach Yang Xianyi and his two sisters English and mathematics. Although the children all performed well academically, the mother, eager for her children to succeed, still insisted on tutors to further improve their grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two younger sisters admired their brother immensely and felt “dumb” by comparison. Yang Minru said: “By the time he could recite the Thirteen Classics perfectly, I still hadn’t learned the Four Books and Five Classics. In middle school, he was already thinking about writing a chaptered novel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru said: “My brother was so smart, at age seven he wrote classical poems and was quick with couplets. The teacher back then was called ‘Xu Jiansheng.’ My brother saw the name and immediately came up with a three-character couplet — ‘Fast Gun Execution’.” (“Xu” matches “fast,” “Jian” matches “gun,” “Sheng” matches “execution.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "The teacher named Xu Jiansheng was not angry about Yang Xianyi’s clever pun but was rather pleased to have such a talented student. It was this Mr. Xu who laid a solid English foundation for the three siblings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Xu was from Guangdong, graduated from Sun Yat-sen University’s English Literature Department, and married surgeon Chi Shiqing. He got along very well with the Yang family. The children called him “Teacher,” the mother called him “Mrs. Chi,” and later the mother even appointed the three children to recognize him as their “godfather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yang family mansion was located on Huayuan Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. It was a large residence, leading a wealthy and leisurely life, with servants to handle daily chores. The three siblings went to the cinema every week to watch both Chinese and foreign films. The mother was both strict and lenient with the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru was a premature baby and always in poor health. The doctor advised the mother to take the child to nature to breathe fresh air. In the summer of 1931, the mother took the three siblings and invited Ms. Xu Jiansheng to go with them to Xiangshan, Beijing, to escape the summer heat. This was the siblings’ first time leaving Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidentally, Yang Xianyi’s cousin Yang Zuanwu and his classmate Luo Peilin from Nankai Middle School were also vacationing in Xiangshan. Luo Peilin came from a prominent Tianjin family and was the top student in the class. That year, the high school graduates were waiting for their university entrance exam results. The youths became playmates, running up and down the mountain, singing, playing chess, and poker in the villas... Luo Peilin got along well with Yang Minru, leaving a good impression on each other. This trip to Xiangshan was a happy time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, a few years later, two uncles tapped into their father’s inheritance. The Yang family had to sell the Huayuan Street house. The eldest sister married out, the second sister died, the concubine took her daughter and left, and the big family dispersed. The first wife, the mother, and the Yang siblings moved to Zhaofeng Road in the French concession, living in rented houses. The large family gradually lived off their dwindling fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1934, Yang Xianyi graduated from high school and was admitted to Yenching University. His grades were so excellent that the university allowed him to skip a grade and start from sophomore year. At this time, a high school English teacher was going back to China for a vacation and wanted to go to Oxford University in England. Yang Xianyi wanted to accompany the teacher to study abroad. The first wife hoped he would stay and inherit the family estate, but he insisted on leaving, and the mother also supported her son's pursuit of overseas study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Yang Minru enrolled in Yenching University’s Chinese Department, studying under Gu Sui. In 1937, Yang Jingru graduated from high school and was admitted directly to Nankai University’s Chinese Department. The \"July 7th Incident\" happened, Nankai University was bombed. The next year, she went as a \"re-enrolled student\" to the Southwest Associated University in Kunming.\n",
      "\n",
      "While studying at Yenching, Yang Minru received letters from Luo Peilin, expressing his affection; by then, he had graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. When Yang Minru went back to Tianjin for vacation, she told her mother. The mother immediately learned that Luo Peilin’s parents had arranged his engagement and ordered her daughter to avoid contact with him. After graduating from university, Yang Minru studied under Professor Gu for one and a half years in graduate school. In the winter vacation of 1939, she took her mother to war-time Chongqing. Mother and daughter traveled with employees of the Bank of China in Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, the Bank of China in Tianjin had hundreds of employees moving en masse to Chongqing, where they intended to set up a branch. The bank manager, Mr. Pan — who had once been a junior clerk when Yang Yuzhang was manager — was very kind to the Yang family mother and daughter. However, the mother was independent and paid all expenses honestly, unwilling to take any advantages. At that time, it was easy for Yang Minru to secure a job at the bank, but she wanted to stand on her own two feet. Neither she nor her mother wanted to use connections to work at the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving in Chongqing, Yang Minru hustled to find work to support herself and her mother. Because she was a graduate student in Chinese at Yenching, it was quite easy, and soon she became a teacher at Chongqing Nankai Middle School. She taught both Chinese and English. Under principal Zhang Boling’s leadership, Chongqing Nankai ran a unique, strict yet lively school, and teachers’ salaries were higher than elsewhere. Yang Minru and her mother were very satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, Luo Peilin had dissolved his arranged marriage and also came to work in Chongqing. With the mother's consent, Yang Minru and he began dating mainly through correspondence.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recently, the book \"Thirty Lectures on Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\" compiled and published under the organization of the Central Propaganda Department, has been publicly released. Divided into 30 topics, this book comprehensively, systematically, and deeply expounds on the great significance, scientific system, rich connotations, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It serves as an important supplementary material for cadres and the public to thoroughly learn and understand Xi Jinping Thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Reading the chapter on comprehensive opening in this book, one cannot help but feel especially proud of our Party’s broad vision and magnanimity in promoting the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up. We are sincerely proud of the ideological height, conceptual depth, and broad vision achieved by our Party’s theoretical innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1978, China has become increasingly open. Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, we opened our doors to development and successfully made a great transformation from closed or semi-closed conditions to all-round opening-up. Facing the new journey ahead, we must promote China’s high-quality economic development under a more open stance to continuously meet the people’s needs for a better life. Currently, the international situation is undergoing profound changes. The world economy and global economic governance system have entered an adjustment period. Protectionist undercurrents in Western developed countries are gradually intensifying; Western countries that initially expanded outward aggressively are showing signs of turning inward. Emerging markets and developing countries show a trend of collective rise, with international power exhibiting patterns of “East rising and West declining” and “South rising and North declining.” At a time when the world is full of uncertainties, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward the important strategic idea of forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Secretary Xi Jinping considers the contemporary requirements of forming this new pattern from the strategic height of human social development and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Seizing opportunities to expand opening-up is not only a valuable experience for China’s reform and development but also the inevitable path to national prosperity and development. For contemporary China, opening-up is not a coincidental tactical choice but an essential strategic decision to pursue high-quality development. In fact, forming a higher-level opening-up pattern has become a key choice concerning China’s destiny and whether the dream of national rejuvenation can be realized. Comprehensive opening-up is not optional; it is a vital magic weapon with which our Party leads the Chinese people to stride forward amid fierce international competition and achieve the great cause of national rejuvenation. Looking around the world, comprehensive opening-up has become the dynamic and fundamental symbol of China’s rapid development and vibrant society. It is the most inspiring and attractive hallmark of the Communist Party of China’s leadership in the international relations of the new era. High-level comprehensive opening-up is a distinct characteristic of contemporary China and a distinctive feature of our Party’s governance in the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary driving force to accelerate the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Opening-up brings progress, while closure inevitably leads to backwardness. Human development depends on improved productive forces, and productive forces rely on the invention and improvement of technology, which in turn depend on human knowledge innovation and accumulated experience. Diverse environments better promote creative thinking, and exchanges and mutual learning between different civilizations facilitate knowledge innovation and dissemination. Only through continuously expanding interactions can human wisdom be inspired, and human knowledge and technology can spread more broadly. The Chinese nation once had a glorious past—an era marked by grand magnanimity and broad inclusiveness in exchanges and mutual learning with neighboring countries. We have also experienced gloomy times caused by isolationism and self-admiration. Opening-up to the outside world is China’s basic national policy and an important magic weapon for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the continuous achievements of socialist modernization. We should expand the scope and strength of opening-up to engage in mutual exchange, learning, and reference with increasingly broad cultures; through exchange, broaden our horizons of experience and thought; through learning, accelerate the transfer of knowledge and skills; and through reference, stimulate the emergence of new knowledge and technologies. Ancient Chinese inventions once benefited the world, while many scientific and technological advances in modern developed countries have pushed forward China’s development. On the path of great rejuvenation, the Chinese nation should embrace increasingly broad-mindedness, so as to stimulate creative vitality and enhance competitiveness through the interaction of different cultures and civilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary precondition to expand the broad world stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only in the vast ocean can a mighty dragon leap and grow; small streams, swamps, or shallow ponds can only harbor small fish and shrimp, not a great whale. Marxism teaches us that practice brings true knowledge, and hard work yields real results. But the breadth of the practice stage often determines the extent of practice; the size of the stage for carrying out a cause often determines the cause’s scale. Circumstances create heroes, and heroes need larger stages. Struggle promotes national rejuvenation, and strivers need greater space. By expanding opening-up, we create a broader space and stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human history has developed through openness, and human civilization has been disseminated and enriched through openness. China is an ancient civilization country but declined in modern times due to rulers’ isolationist policies. At that time, the world, due to the discovery of the New World, transformed from isolated independent existences into an increasingly interconnected whole, creating a stage for the rise of the Western world. Today, our opening-up is not a return to ancient Han and Tang dynasty schemes toward neighboring countries, but a true integration into the trend of economic globalization to move toward the world and provide a broader stage for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up can we better coordinate domestic and international markets, resources, and rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new pattern of comprehensive opening-up involves not only material aspects but also human resources. We should seek out intelligent minds globally for our use, coordinate domestic and international talent resources, stimulate more intellectual momentum, and assist the implementation of innovation-driven strategies. Today, realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation means returning to the center of the world stage—a global stage far beyond the flat perspective of ancient “all under heaven.” Only by bearing greater responsibility and playing a greater role on this global stage can we claim to have achieved the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the inevitable choice for leading the building of a community with a shared future for humanity through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China’s reform, opening-up, and peaceful development constitute historically significant events at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries—after all, China accounts for one-fifth of the world’s population. China’s development has not only freed the Chinese nation from a modern history of poverty and backwardness but, with its enormous potential market, has also brought opportunities for global development.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this planet, economic globalization leads to complex and increasingly close connections, forming a situation of “you in me and me in you,” a pattern in which one prospers, all prosper; one suffers, all suffer. However, some short-sighted actors loudly promote “free trade” when it benefits them but quickly build protectionist fences when it disadvantages them slightly. In the face of this situation, China confidently insists on expanding opening-up and strives to form a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote building a community with a shared future for humanity and achieve win-win sharing, we must broaden and deepen opening-up. Our Belt and Road Initiative is a new international cooperation platform to enhance connectivity, injecting new impetus into common development and advancing the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. The Belt and Road Initiative emanates from China but belongs to the world. It is an open platform that should transcend geographical, civilizational, and developmental boundaries. It is a road of cooperation and shared success that should continually extend and expand. As long as all parties clarify the major goals of connectivity and win-win cooperation, strengthen policy coordination, align their development strategies, adhere to consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, enhance policy communication, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds, rely on project-driven approaches, and deepen pragmatic cooperation, the initiative will surely promote development and prosperity in various countries and benefit peoples worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the only way to demonstrate the vitality of socialism through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Socialism was realized in the wave of the international communist movement and can only develop and grow amid international currents. Our reform and opening-up have pioneered the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and ushered in a bright prospect for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by further deepening comprehensive opening-up can we inject strong momentum into realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and invigorate scientific socialism in China with great vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s open door is opening wider and wider, not only promoting the continuous development and improvement of the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics but also holding high in the world the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, demonstrating the realistic path for developing countries guided by Marxism toward modernization. It also provides a new choice for countries and peoples worldwide who wish to accelerate development while maintaining their independence, contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to human problems.\n",

This evaluation model considers both the company’s financial data over the past 3–5 years and comprehensively measures brand factors such as brand age, brand recognition, brand extension capability, and market potential. To ensure fairness and scientific rigor, World Brand Lab first collected relevant data from institutions such as the National Bureau of Statistics, Customs, and industry associations, and conducted extensive surveys across numerous enterprises in different industries. It then selected 800 local brands from key industries as candidates and ultimately identified the 500 most valuable brands.\n",

Currently, it is the peak season for pomegranate harvesting and sales, attracting merchants from all over the country.\n",

      "Following one truckload after another from across the nation, the reporter visited Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Co., Ltd., located in Baicao Village, Luchang Town, Huili City. On the sorting assembly line, plump, rosy pomegranates are selected, weighed, and loaded onto vehicles bound for Southeast Asia and other destinations, beginning their international journey. \"At present, our annual export volume is about 10,000 tons, with operating income around 50 million yuan,\" said Zuo Ziwen, chairman of the Wanqing Pomegranate Professional Cooperative in Huili.\n",

      "Zuo Ziwen, a native of Huili, has cultivated pomegranates for more than 30 years. Casually picking up a soft-seed pomegranate, he proudly peeled the skin and said to the reporter, \"Look how good our Huili pomegranates are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even good products can face sales difficulties. \"In the past, our premium produce couldn't fetch good prices. When the market was bad, a whole year's efforts would go to waste,\" Zuo said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason was that the pomegranates hit the market in a concentrated time frame, causing accumulation and, combined with the inability to extend shelf life, farmers could only sell at low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain freshness and extend the preservation period, Zuo began building cold storage controlled atmosphere warehouses many years ago after extensive investigation. Today, a modern pomegranate trading center and auction market, integrating pomegranate grading and sorting, online transactions, information release, storage and processing, cold chain logistics, financial services, and big data analysis, has been established in Baicao Village.\n",

      "\"This agricultural product sorting site covers 40,000 square meters, including 37 controlled atmosphere fresh-keeping warehouses for fruits and vegetables, used for cold storage. It can store 6,500 tons of agricultural products,\" Zuo introduced. The operation of these controlled atmosphere warehouses adjusts the marketing peak and off-peak seasons, allowing sales to be staggered.

They emphasize the procedural, standardized, and regulated sequencing of technical methods, providing strong support for the efficient exploration and development of the Northwest Oilfield.\n",

      "Focusing on Strengthening Basic Research to Consolidate the Foundation of Technological Innovation\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are closely related to the geological activity of strike-slip faults, forming special fault-controlled reservoirs. Researchers have summarized a “follow the clue from strike-slip faults to explore oil and gas reservoirs” technical route. However, because the target reservoirs are deeply buried, the artificially returned seismic reflection signals to the surface are weak and further affected by near-surface desert conditions and deep high-speed igneous rock shielding, making signal “decoding” extremely challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, researchers have established a series of three-dimensional seismic geological models of the strike-slip fault systems and ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs in the Tarim Basin. Based on three-dimensional numerical and physical simulation methods, they study seismic wave propagation mechanisms in ultra-deep complex fault-controlled reservoirs, summarizing propagation laws and seismic response characteristics for different structural styles of fault-controlled reservoirs. These foundational research results provide analytical bases for subsequent seismic deployment and interpretation, and theoretical bases for optimizing seismic data acquisition parameters and improving imaging accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the Institute has promoted basic research on rock physics in the ultra-deep domain, building high-level experimental platforms and key technologies. Addressing the ultra-high temperature and high-pressure underground environment of ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs, the first comprehensive rock physics testing platform in the industry targeting well depths of 10,000 meters has been established. This advances rock physics experiments of formation temperature and pressure from shallower than 5,000 meters to deeper than 12,000 meters, driving the development of deep and ultra-deep rock physics experimental equipment and technologies domestically and internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on ultra-high temperature and pressure testing, researchers clarified the temperature and pressure dependence of ultra-high temperature and pressure ultrasonic sensors, developed sensor temperature-pressure correction technologies, revealed the high temperature and pressure rock physics properties of major diagenetic minerals in carbonate rocks, and constructed rock physics models and interpretation volumes applicable to deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs. These have achieved applied effectiveness in ultra-deep geological target implementation and engineering “sweet spot” prediction, forming multiple original theories and results supporting integrated geophysical exploration engineering for “deep earth engineering.”\n",

      "Seismic processing and imaging technology is like performing a CT scan on the earth, an important means to open a high-definition underground window.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle problems of weak seismic reflection energy and low signal-to-noise ratio in ultra-deep seismic data, the Institute gradually developed the “two wides, one long, one small” (wide azimuth, wide frequency band, long array, small cell) seismic acquisition technology. This effectively weakens the signal shielding effect of abnormal shallow velocity bodies, enhances the amount of effective seismic reflection information in ultra-deep zones, and obtains high-quality data containing reflection information from more azimuth angles, significantly improving the capability to identify ultra-deep complex structures, geological anomalies, faults, lithology, and physical properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harsh desert surface conditions and complex underground structures cause the development of various strong interference waves, evident near-surface absorption and attenuation effects, and severe shielding and interference impacts from special rock masses. To address these challenges, researchers innovatively developed the “three guarantees and one measurement” processing technology series (guaranteeing diffraction, guaranteeing amplitude, guaranteeing weak low-frequency signals, and parameter testing to pre-stack time migration imaging). This includes ultra-deep weak signal preservation and noise reduction technologies based on desert surface conditions, near-surface Q compensation, amplitude and wavelet consistency processing, and layer-controlled data-driven suppression of inter-layer multiples. These improve the energy and signal-to-noise ratio of effective seismic signals and broaden the effective bandwidth, providing high-fidelity seismic data for subsequent seismic imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "For precise imaging of ultra-deep target oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, researchers innovated a comprehensive angle domain imaging and broadband advanced reverse-time migration imaging technology series. Full azimuth angle domain imaging makes full use of wide-azimuth seismic information and performs imaging in local underground angle domains, multidimensionally depicting the contours and internal structures of fault-controlled reservoirs and dissolution caves. Based on reverse-time migration imaging theory of analytic wavefields, anisotropic reverse-time migration technology was innovated, effectively reducing effects of fracture heterogeneity. Broadband Q compensation reverse-time migration was developed to effectively compensate for signal attenuation during ultra-long-distance propagation. High-resolution least squares reverse-time migration technology was established to compensate for underground illumination and improve imaging accuracy for steeply dipping structures and ultra-deep small-scale anomalous bodies.\n",

An innovative deep learning-based adaptive deep convolutional neural network P-impedance inversion method was developed to solve difficulties in applying previous models. By combining model-driven and data-driven approaches, this method enhances the interpretability of the seismic inversion process and results, showing remarkable effects when describing small-scale fracture-cavity assemblies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle ultra-deep strike-slip fault classification prediction challenges, a machine learning-based fault classification prediction technology was developed and tested, achieving good application results. This technology establishes the relationship between seismic attributes and drilling losses, improving fault detection efficiency and accuracy and advancing fine fault prediction technology for strike-slip fault zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "For quantitative characterization of ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs, an innovative quantitative description technology based on frequency-variant attributes was developed. This technology fully exploits differences of reservoirs in the frequency domain, achieving breakthroughs in multi-scale fracture-cavity prediction and correction, as well as quantitative fracture scale characterization. For the first time, the concept of fracture scale indicator (FSI) was proposed, establishing a complete workflow covering fundamental theory, algorithm design, forward modeling, real data application, and effect evaluation, forming a reservoir connectivity evaluation and analysis technical scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the shielding effect of the strong reflection on the top surface of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation on underlying fault-controlled reservoirs, an optimized matching tracking strong reflection separation technology was innovatively developed, significantly reducing interference of strong reflections on describing deep fault-controlled reservoirs and creating better conditions for quantitative reservoir description. This technology has now been integrated into the latest version of the NEWS software and has become a necessary step in almost all quantitative descriptions of fault-controlled reservoirs in the Shunbei area, effectively increasing exploration success rates and economic benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, geophysical exploration technology has gradually developed from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, four-dimensional, and five-dimensional exploration, supporting discoveries of structural-type oil and gas reservoirs in the Triassic strata of Tahe, Yakela buried hill-type reservoirs, Ordovician karst fracture-cavity-type oil and gas reservoirs in Tahe, and fault-controlled fracture-cave type reservoirs in the Shunbei oilfield. Exploration depths have extended from 4,200 meters to 7,900 meters, effectively promoting the discovery, reserve addition, and production increase of various types of oil and gas reservoirs in Northwest Oilfield.\n",

      "Duobao Town is the largest vegetable planting township in Tianmen, where white radish covers 100,000 mu (about 6,667 hectares) with an output value exceeding 400 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the town’s total agricultural output value.\n",
      "\n",
      "From \"basket-carrying small sellers\" confined to Hubei to \"beautifully packaged and shipped\" nationwide, what kind of transformational path has this radish town taken? On September 13, Hubei Daily’s all-media reporters conducted an on-site visit to Duobao Town.\n",

      "From Fragmented to Continuous: The Initial Formation of Radish Town\n",
      "\n",
      "Watering, thinning, fertilizing, weeding... In the autumn planting season, at the vegetable planting base of Hubei Minghe Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. located in Dazhongxin Village, Duobao Town, more than a hundred workers are busy daily in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "This company is the leading enterprise in Tianmen’s vegetable industry, with over 8,000 mu (about 533 hectares) of self-cultivated vegetables and more than 20,000 mu (about 1,333 hectares) under contracted planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, we could not even imagine such a scale,” said Wu Hanping, the company’s chairman. He began vegetable planting in 2012, when manual labor dominated with low mechanization, and 300 mu (20 hectares) was already the upper limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Duobao Town mainly grew cotton, wheat, and soybeans; vegetables were scatteredly grown by individual households, resulting in low output, poor appearance, and closed markets. Wu Hanping and a group of large growers began frequently visiting places like Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan, bringing back advanced vegetable cultivation concepts and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Previously, vegetable seedlings had to be purchased from other places at a high price of 1 to 1.5 yuan per seedling, leading to high costs,” said Wu Hanping. In 2017, the company decided to build its own seedling greenhouse. At that time, solar greenhouses were popular, but he insisted on building connected greenhouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar greenhouses can only be used for a few months in autumn and winter, while connected greenhouses allow temperature and humidity adjustment for year-round seedling cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Minghe’s connected greenhouse seedling base, the reporter saw modern facilities fully equipped, including evaporative cooling pads, automatic sprinkler irrigation, integrated water and fertilizer systems, heating and supplementary lighting—fully embodying “technological sophistication.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, with the rise of facility agriculture and advancement of agricultural mechanization, Duobao’s vegetable industry has rapidly grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, radish sowing relied on manual seed placement, with one person sowing only 1 mu per day. Later, sowing machines became widely used; one machine can sow 100 mu per day. Now, except for weeding and harvesting, the process is basically fully mechanized, reaching an average yield of more than 8,000 jin (about 4 tons) per mu in a normal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganlu Village is a well-known large vegetable village. Village Party Branch Secretary Wen Yuanjun introduced that the village has over 3,000 mu of vegetable planting area and radiates more than 10,000 mu around it. Large vegetable growers in the village commonly earn over 1 million yuan annually, while ordinary villagers can earn more than 100,000 yuan a year from land lease fees and working in cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Duobao Town’s vegetable planting area is stable at about 120,000 mu (8,000 hectares), with over 30 varieties including peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc., driving about 26,000 vegetable farming households to increase their per household income by 12,000 yuan.\n",

      "From Single to Diverse: Radishes Come in “Three Six Nine Grades”\n",

      "No matter how good the quality of agricultural products is, if market channels are blocked, they can only rot in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on, due to poor logistics and information, the sales radius of Duobao radishes was limited to the Tianmen surrounding area. Wu Hanping remembers deeply: “For wholesale markets farther away, the price when calling was around 1 yuan per jin, but by the time the radishes were transported there, the price dropped to a few mao (tens of cents).” From initially having people stationed at major markets to inquire about prices to now accessing nationwide market price lists online, both information and logistics bottlenecks have been overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, smooth information and logistics have turned the whole country into one large market, intensifying competition. To sell radishes far and well, stable quality is paramount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minghe Company has implemented healthy cultivation techniques characterized by reducing fertilizer, pesticides, and labor while increasing production, income, and efficiency (\"three increases and three reductions\"), decreasing fertilizer and pesticide use by 5% each per mu, reducing labor by over 13% per mu, and increasing yield by more than 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innovation in sales philosophy is equally important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Duobao radishes were sold with dirt, loaded directly from the field onto trucks with no sorting, grading, or packaging. Purchasers had to spend manpower, materials, and time on classification and sorting, raising costs far above other mature suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As market consumer groups become segmented, agricultural products must be strictly graded and sold according to standards to differentiate pricing and boost sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, after listing, Duobao radishes are classified into four grades based on size, weight, appearance: premium, general, small radishes, and substandard. The price difference between premium and general grades exceeds 0.3 yuan per jin. “The premium radishes sorted out not only look good but also have value; packaged as vegetable gift boxes, they are sold by count,” said Wu Hanping. Today, Duobao vegetables have successfully entered supply chain platforms of retailers such as Wangjiahuan, Qian Dama, and Duoduo Maicai, directly supplying the tables of thousands of households nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, Minghe Company recorded vegetable sales of 80 million yuan and expects sustained growth this year.\n",

      "On September 15, trucks loaded with white radishes entered Minghe Company, where prepared workers conducted washing, sorting, and packaging in an orderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the town’s radishes had just been planted recently, why was radish washing already underway?\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is from our planting in Shaanxi,” revealed Wu Hanping. Formed through selfless epidemic assistance relationships, last year Wu was invited to inspect Shaanxi, and local governments have repeatedly invited them to develop agricultural planting and help local farmers prosper. After multiple inspections and tests, they have rented 400 mu in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, for vegetable planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to geographical differences, vegetables can be sown in Shaanxi in June and July, coinciding with Tianmen’s off-season harvests. Wu Hanping said, “Over the years, we have accumulated solid planting skills and capital strength. Now, trying to extend outwards can lengthen the planting chain and achieve differentiated competition.” He added that they will further expand vegetable planting in northern provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Hanping is not an isolated case of planting vegetables out-of-province. In Ganlu Village, five cooperatives have planted more than 3,000 mu of vegetables in Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shunfa Vegetable Professional Cooperative head Wen Yuanzu said that the continuous planting scale in Duobao and surrounding areas has developed to a certain extent, with land transfer prices exceeding 1,000 yuan per mu, while places like Shaanxi have larger continuous planting spaces and relatively lower land transfer prices, offering obvious cost advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, we went out to learn and catch up with advanced areas’ planting technologies,” said Wu Hanping. “Now, choosing to go out means we can export technology, expand the ‘Duobao Radish’ brand influence, and continue to grow and strengthen the Duobao radish industry.”\n",

For Helin Society, this spirit is their institutional soul and the central theme guiding all their projects. In 2014, Helin Society launched the Natural Art Festival, inviting experts from art, sociology, design, and planning fields to gather and discuss how to enhance relationships between humans and nature, and improve the dialogue between art and rural culture.\n",

      "This year, the Helin Society moved a big step forward by initiating the second Natural Art Festival. They expanded participation nationwide and launched an artist rural residency program, supporting artists to stay in villages for some time through various approaches to inspire creativity, thus truly bringing art and rural life together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first residency took place in Chuodunshan Village, Kunshan. Three young artists supported through application arrived locally. Natural artist Chen Zhipeng, advocate of natural music and perception of natural art, is a pioneer of natural music. Zhou Weiwei, a sound explorer, natural musician, and calligraphy practitioner, was the second. The third, Fang Shenlan, is a body narrative artist.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the residency, the team researched and studied local natural landscapes, indigenous culture, and traditional folk music, sensing current environmental and human interactions and creating multiple improvisations on site. The artists visited local writer Zhou Gang, listening to his stories about the history of Chuodunshan Village, the Yushan Elegant Gathering led by local sage Gu Aying, as well as the rise and decline of Kunqu opera’s Zhèngshēng Huangfanzhuo style and local puppet theater.\n",

Natural plant expert teacher Qiu Qiu taught kids to pickle salted vegetables on the spot, a novel and refreshing experience for urban-raised children. Everyone selected fresh vegetables they liked, massaged in salt, bottled their creations, and joyfully took home their hand-made salted vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Qingcheng Field Scenery workshop also unexpectedly attracted large crowds and popularity. Many had eaten fox nuts but few had seen fresh ones, and even fewer knew how to peel them. The workshop team from Qingcheng, Kunshan led participants to learn about fox nut knowledge, see fascinating photos, and practice peeling fox nuts using \"copper fingers,\" experiencing firsthand the meaning of “each grain is hard-earned.” After peeling, children played interactive games and quizzes, and all enjoyed a small cup of delicious and nutritious fresh fox nut syrup on site.\n",

      "Dequejia’s home is in Maduo County, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. This area is the core region of the Yellow River Source Park within Sanjiangyuan National Park and an important ecological barrier on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Known as the “County of a Thousand Lakes,” its rich water and grasslands have nourished generations of grassland people.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, affected by global warming and overgrazing, by the early 21st century the grasslands suffered severe desertification, lake areas shrank, and wild animal numbers sharply declined... the ecology was continually deteriorating.\n",

      "In 2016, the pilot work of the Sanjiangyuan National Park system began. The Yellow River Source Park fully implemented the “one household, one post” ecological protection policy, gradually turning herdsmen into ecological protectors. Dequejia took on a new identity as a “guardian of the homeland”: “We patrol the grasslands at least three times a week, pick up trash, record and monitor wild animals, and exchange knowledge about grassland protection with each other.”\n",

In 1998, only 12 to 16 wild northeast tigers remained in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, the country successively took measures including establishing nature reserves, halting commercial logging of natural forests, and clearing hills and brush, achieving some effect. However, challenges remained: protection work involved multiple departments and administrative regions, ecosystems were fragmented, and the tiger and leopard protected areas suffered severe fragmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the pilot work for the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park began, spanning Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. Administrative functions of seven departments, including land and forestry, were transferred to the park administration. Forest vegetation restoration, relocating production and living activities from core zones, and constructing corridors for tiger and leopard migration and spread continued—efforts to let tigers “regain control” of the forest.\n",

      "Li Wansong, who has lived for generations in Tongmu Village, Wuyishan, Fujian Province, never expected his three jobs—to tea garden owner, ecological forest ranger, and guesthouse operator—would merge so well. All these changes came after the construction of the Wuyishan National Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wuyishan National Park covers 1,280 square kilometers across Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. It is renowned for its rich biological resources and biodiversity, and as the birthplace of world-famous oolong and black tea. Tea is one of the pillar industries here, and Li Wansong has been managing tea gardens for over 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Driven by economic interests in the past, people often cut down forests to plant tea, damaging the mountain ecology and reducing species diversity, weakening soil stabilization and air purification functions,” Li Wansong said. Since the park’s establishment, protection efforts have intensified, and the phenomenon of forest destruction for tea planting has been curbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, “protecting the ecological environment is protecting our home” has become a consensus among the people of Wuyishan. After the national park was established, Li Wansong and villagers became ecological forest rangers. “Now we apply comprehensive ‘sky-ground’ all-weather monitoring and management, greatly enhancing ecological protection capabilities,” Li said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural ecological environment in the park continues to improve: forest vegetation recovery accelerates in the Fujian section, with forest coverage reaching 96.72%; surface water and air quality indicators all meet national Grade I standards; more than 30 new species, such as Wuyishan tree frog and Wuyishan cardamom, have been recorded and published.\n",
      "\n",
      "While guarding the beautiful ecology, the park actively promotes unification of ecological protection, green development, and improvement of livelihoods, guiding tea farmers to build ecological tea gardens, promoting integration of tea culture, industry, and technology, enabling villagers to further enjoy ecological dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With the improving environment, our village’s over 9,000 mu of tea gardens no longer use fertilizers or pesticides; tea quality keeps getting better, and many first-time customers become returning clients,” Li said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protecting green mountains and clear waters has also brought gold and silver mountains. Besides managing tea gardens and patrolling forests, Li Wansong transformed his home into a guesthouse. Visitor numbers increase yearly, and on holidays, guest rooms are almost always fully booked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of national parks emphasizes protection and also requires guidance to encourage public participation and sharing. The first batch of national parks, based on their unique natural and cultural endowments, have opened rich routes and areas to the public. For example, Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park has set up 10 high-quality ecological tourism routes and science popularization corridors; the Sichuan section of Giant Panda National Park has planned three distinctive tourism routes including Guangyuan Tangjiahe Park and Ya’an Labah River Park, as well as 11 mature tourism areas.\n",

      "Public doubts triggered by a traffic accident involving Xiaomi’s automobile and issues of “false advertising” regarding the vehicle’s front hood continue to intensify. On the evening of May 15, Lei Jun, founder of Xiaomi Group (1810.HK), delivered an internal speech reviewing the impact of the Xiaomi auto accident, the social responsibilities that a large company like Xiaomi Group must shoulder, and disclosed progress on Xiaomi’s smartphone SoC chip, the Surge O1.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are voices filled with anticipation for Xiaomi’s renewed disclosure of the SoC chip, while others question the depth of Lei Jun’s reflections. Within nearly a year, Xiaomi Group’s stock price rose from a low of HKD 15.36 to a high of HKD 59.45, but has recently experienced continuous fluctuations due to issues related to the automobile business. Supported by Xiaomi Group’s diversified business and the brand image shaped by Lei Jun, the secondary market has not yet seen large-scale panic selling. At the time of reporting, Xiaomi’s stock price stood at HKD 51.05, up 1.79%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grabbing at everything at once leads to failure in the most important matters.” Lei Jun once stated that while dedicating half his effort to the automobile business, he devoted about one-third of his energy to the smartphone business, as smartphones are Xiaomi’s foundation for survival. However, with both the smartphone and automobile sectors facing intense competition, the allocation of the leader’s attention becomes especially critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Xiaomi’s establishment fifteen years ago, whether it was the original “Eight Pillars,” the later introduction of an external executive team, or the internally nurtured young talent pool, Lei Jun, as the group’s brand symbol, has played a decisive role in all aspects. To some extent, the Xiaomi brand has become directly associated with Lei Jun personally. But as internal project competition grows fiercer, even someone who “bets everything” like Lei Jun needs to seriously consider that not every achievement has to be “mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An Unexpected Blow”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of February 29, an accident on the Deshang Expressway in Anhui abruptly ended months of high-profile marketing for Xiaomi’s automobile. The official investigation results on the traffic accident have not yet been released, and Xiaomi’s car was again embroiled in controversy over false advertising of its carbon fiber front hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, one of the core selling points of the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra was its carbon fiber dual air-duct front hood, priced at 42,000 yuan. Official promotions credited it with “replicating the aerodynamic design of the Nürburgring prototype car,” “increasing downforce,” and “optimizing heat dissipation.” However, after delivery, car owners discovered through testing that the air duct openings could not even blow a tissue, and upon disassembly, the internal structure was no different from an ordinary aluminum hood. It was also not connected to the brake cooling system nor did it generate the advertised downforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the reduced functionality and misleading promotion, some owners initiated collective rights protection, demanding vehicle returns and compensation. On May 7, Xiaomi Auto issued an official apology admitting “unclear information expression” and proposed a compensation plan: undelivered orders could switch free of charge to an aluminum front hood, and customers who had already taken delivery would receive 20,000 points (equivalent to about 2,000 yuan).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this plan was not accepted by the owner group—the replacement required queuing for more than 30 weeks, the point compensation covered only 4.7% of the optional fee, and it did not address refund requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Xiang, Director of the Vodafone Digital Auto International Cooperation Research Center, told Yicai Global that some car manufacturers currently promote vehicle features before actual production starts and accept blind orders, but there are many uncertainties in the process of research, development, and production of such vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This series of social incidents also slowed Lei Jun’s marketing activity on social media. In his May 15 review speech, Lei Jun said: “At the end of March, a sudden traffic accident shattered everything. The company faced a storm of questioning, criticism, and accusations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one expected the impact of this accident to be so large, nor the blow to Xiaomi to be so severe,” Lei Jun said. The public’s expectations and demands for Xiaomi far exceeded imagination. Xiaomi’s current scale, influence, and social attention have all reached very high levels, and society and the public require Xiaomi to take on the responsibilities of a true large corporate industry leader—this is a responsibility Xiaomi cannot evade.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Safety Measures to Technological Investment\n",
      "\n",
      "After the automobile accident, Lei Jun said he held countless meetings with the group management and colleagues in the automobile division to think about how to systematically solve problems and how to respond to the public’s higher demands with more convincing operational and governance performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lei Jun did not specify concrete solutions or countermeasures but summarized them as “technology-oriented.” He said Xiaomi proposed five years ago to invest more than 100 billion yuan in R&D over five years, with an expected investment exceeding 30 billion this year. Simultaneously, Lei Jun disclosed externally that Xiaomi’s self-developed smartphone SoC chip, Surge O1, will be released by the end of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 16th, Lei Jun further detailed Xiaomi’s chip development history, saying Xiaomi’s chip R&D started in September 2014, and in February 2017 Xiaomi held its first chip launch event.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Xiaomi established Pinecone Electronics, starting its path of self-developed chips. After 28 months, it completed the entire process from project initiation, tape-out, to mass production of the Surge S1, released externally in 2017. Although based on the 28nm process technology, the Surge S1 made Xiaomi the fourth smartphone manufacturer after Apple, Samsung, and Huawei to independently develop chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, after the S1, the S2 did not arrive as scheduled, and all self-developed SoC chip disclosures from Xiaomi have since stalled. In March 2023, Xiaomi launched the MIX FOLD foldable phone, which for the first time adopted a self-developed ISP (Image Signal Processor) chip “Surge C1.” The ISP chip was separated from the SoC and located independently on the motherboard. Lei Jun said at the time that this was just a small step in Xiaomi’s continued exploration of professional imaging. It has been seven years since Xiaomi launched its first chip, and the company’s chipmaking journey has never stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Lei Jun emphasized the importance of chipmaking for Xiaomi: many believe the chip industry is risky with a high failure rate, but Xiaomi insists on doing it. He views chips as the technological high ground for smartphones; Xiaomi must master core technology. If Xiaomi wants to dominate the smartphone market, it must make long-term investments in chip technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defending the Smartphone Fortress, Venturing into Risky Automobile Waters\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it is self-developed chips or investment in automobile safety, Xiaomi Group currently faces multiple pressures. Lei Jun, wearing many hats, faces dual challenges of the smartphone market’s intense competition and the early stages of the automobile business. Planning priorities, personal effort, and group resource allocation balance are urgent tasks for Lei Jun.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, in the smartphone market, according to Canalys data, driven by national subsidies and an overall consumption recovery, the mainland China smartphone market experienced a moderate rebound with shipments rising 5% year-on-year to 70.9 million units in Q1 2025. Among them, Xiaomi shipped 13.3 million units, up 40% year-on-year. Benefiting from product and channel synergy, Xiaomi regained the No.1 market share position in mainland China with 19%, maintaining its domestic target to increase market share by at least 1% annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in international markets excluding China, Xiaomi’s overseas smartphone shipments declined approximately 8.7% year-on-year. Canalys chief analyst Jason Low said, “Smartphone conditions across regions are becoming complex. Areas such as India, Latin America, and the Middle East, which saw strong growth over the past year, have experienced clear declines, showing saturation in replacement demand for mass-market models. Most Android brands actively adjusted inventory levels in Q1 to avoid impacting new product launches and channel pricing. After a brief recovery, Europe’s market declined again as manufacturers struggled with high flagship inventory from late last year and disruptions caused by ecological design legislation affecting mid-to-low end lines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the domestic new energy vehicle market, although authorities have proposed further strengthening market supervision and rectifying illegal marketing practices, the close-quarters battle has not ended, and price wars continue. According to insurance data provided by Li Yanwei, an expert from China Automobile Dealers Association, Xiaomi’s car sales have declined for three consecutive weeks. Although Xiaomi Group’s public relations head Wang Hua attributed recent sales trends to cyclical factors, both smartphones and automobiles remain at critical stages where success cannot rely on one person alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lei Jun, since Xiaomi officially announced its automobile business, his focus and efforts have gradually shifted from smartphones to automobiles. But as Lei Jun said in the 2024 annual speech: “The Xiaomi SU7 only means Xiaomi Auto has finally taken a seat at the table, but true success is still far away. Xiaomi Auto’s ‘Long March’ is only just beginning.”\n",

      "The depth and breadth of industrial collaborative development profoundly affect the quality and effectiveness of regional development and are key areas for promoting the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region. Lian Yuming, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and director of the Beijing International Urban Development Research Institute, suggests building the sub-center of the city into a bridgehead for industrial collaboration in Jing-Jin-Ji, and establishing a high-quality integrated development demonstration zone between Tongzhou District and the three northern counties to provide new space for industrial collaboration among the three places.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The 14th Five-Year Plan period is a crucial stage for the Jing-Jin-Ji coordinated development strategy to connect the past and the future. Breakthroughs should be sought in three ‘new’ areas to build Beijing’s sub-center into the industrial collaboration bridgehead of Jing-Jin-Ji,” said Lian Yuming. First, accelerate the construction of a high-quality integrated development demonstration zone between Tongzhou District and the three northern counties, providing new space for industrial collaboration in Jing-Jin-Ji. Further amplify the locational advantages of the three northern counties, speed up the establishment of a dense, multi-level, multi-mode, and multi-standard seamless comprehensive transportation system. On the foundation of forming a high-density commuting flow, further promote the interaction of business flows, information flows, capital flows, and technology flows, enabling the two places to establish closer economic and social ties. More importantly, focus on building a business environment with uniform processes, identical requirements, and consistent standards; accelerate governmental information system integration and upgrades; establish a data sharing and exchange system along with a shared data resource catalog; collaboratively advance “Internet + government services” and “Internet + market supervision,” and swiftly realize an integrated business environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, promote the construction of a national-level green exchange facing the global market to provide a new engine for industrial collaboration in Jing-Jin-Ji. Lian Yuming recommends leveraging the sub-center by “promoting the upgrade of the Beijing Green Exchange into a national-level green exchange aimed at the global market,” strengthening the carbon trading center functions, accelerating the development of green finance, innovating financial products, and supporting carbon peak and carbon neutrality actions along with technological research and development. This would in turn drive the mutual flow of green funds across the Jing-Jin-Ji region, deeply integrate green standards, and coordinate the overall layout of the green energy industry, exploring joint governance of “dual carbon” goals. On one hand, with carbon reduction as a strategic direction, comprehensively advance pollution control, ecological protection, and climate change response, strengthening the synergy and enhancement of pollution reduction and carbon emission cuts; on the other hand, leverage the green energy abundance in Hebei and Inner Mongolia, strengthen the new energy industry through integrated layout, increase the substitution of new energy, and promote a fully green transition of economic and social development in the Jing-Jin-Ji region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, promote coordinated innovation among the three free trade zones (FTZs) to provide a new platform for industrial collaboration in Jing-Jin-Ji. Lian Yuming stated that promoting coordinated innovation among the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei FTZs should serve at least two functions. First is to establish a coordinated innovation mechanism among the FTZs based on “policy sharing, joint innovation promotion, and platform co-construction,” creating a new platform for higher-quality integrated development of Jing-Jin-Ji, and driving industrial collaborative innovation through systemic integrated innovation. Promote policy communication and mutual learning among the three FTZs, reinforce the replication, promotion, and exchange of reform and innovation experiences, and jointly launch a batch of innovative and leading FTZ reform achievements. Second is to extend the institutional and mechanistic reforms of the three FTZs into the core areas of Jing-Jin-Ji, fully exploiting the advantages of hinterland and broad markets, advancing market-oriented and internationalized factor allocation, and forming more competitive and influential industrial and supply chains in the Jing-Jin-Ji region.\n",

      "This newspaper report by reporter Jing Wenna states that recently, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has intensively carried out work to ensure stable supply and prices of important livelihood commodities. Experts and industry associations were organized to deeply analyze the supply and demand of various products such as grains, oils, meat, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables in 2024, especially during the Spring Festival period. The monitoring of market price dynamics and situation assessments for key varieties across regions have been strengthened. In conjunction with relevant departments, meetings were held to specifically study the stable supply and price work for the Spring Festival period.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the NDRC has instructed localities to make every effort to ensure market supply and stable prices during the Spring Festival, creating a good price environment for the people to enjoy the holiday. The measures include:  \n",
      "1. Strengthening supply organization. Local governments are required to carefully assess trends in passenger flows, logistics, and weather changes during the holidays, and conduct consumption demand analysis. They are to fully leverage key enterprises such as agricultural wholesale markets and large supermarkets to coordinate production and sales, making sufficient stock in advance. Regions affected by rain and snow should increase stockpiling efforts and ensure smooth logistics.  \n",
      "2. Launching reserve releases and fair-price sales. Depending on market conditions, the release of reserves in small packages of grains, oils, pork, vegetables, etc., will be carried out as needed. Fair-price sales of key livelihood commodities will be initiated according to local conditions to guide prices to stay at reasonable levels.  \n",
      "3. Ensuring terminal supply. Major supermarkets are required to promptly stock and shelve goods based on changes in demand, reasonably allocate delivery staff, and ensure smooth “last mile” logistics.  \n",
      "4. Strengthening market supervision. Market and price supervision and inspection efforts will be increased to guide related entities to operate legally and compliantly. Price violation behaviors will be severely punished according to law to ensure the market runs smoothly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the production situation of important livelihood commodities nationwide is stable and improving, with ample market supply, providing a solid foundation for maintaining supply and stable prices during the Spring Festival. Regarding grains and oils, grain production has achieved another bumper harvest, with output remaining above 1.3 trillion jin (650 million tons) for nine consecutive years. The reserves of finished grains and oils in 36 large and medium-sized cities can meet more than 15 days of consumption. For meat, eggs, and vegetables, pork and egg production capacity is ample, vegetable planting areas have remained stable or slightly increased year-on-year, and winter and spring vegetable reserves in northern large cities can meet more than 7 days of consumption.\n",

      "A strong nation must first strengthen its agriculture; only with strong agriculture can the nation be strong. Recently, the \"Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Learning from and Effectively Applying the ‘Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation’ Project Experiences to Vigorously Promote Comprehensive Rural Revitalization\" was issued. This is the 12th Central No. 1 Document guiding the work on agriculture, rural areas, and farmers (“three rural” issues) since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, once again sending a strong signal to place emphasis on agriculture and rural areas and pointing out the direction and practical path to accelerating rural revitalization and building a strong agricultural country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agriculture is the foundation of the world.\" Over the past year, facing a complex and challenging domestic and international situation, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we overcame multiple adverse factors including serious natural disasters. Grain production has achieved a bumper harvest for twenty consecutive years, breaking historical records again; farmers’ incomes have grown rapidly; rural society remains harmonious and stable. These provide a solid foundation for promoting economic recovery, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, and focusing on high-quality development. Building a modern socialist country in all respects is still most arduous and demanding in rural areas. To advance modernization with Chinese characteristics, we must persistently consolidate the agricultural foundation and promote comprehensive rural revitalization. To do a good job with “three rural” work in the new era and new journey, we must take advancing comprehensive rural revitalization as the overall grasp, uphold people-centered development thinking, fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, fight a beautiful battle for rural revitalization, and paint a new picture of livable, workable, and beautiful countryside, thereby speeding up agricultural and rural modernization and better advancing modernization in a Chinese style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promoting comprehensive rural revitalization should be guided by learning from and applying the experience of the “Ten Million Project.” During his work in Zhejiang, General Secretary Xi Jinping personally planned and promoted the \"Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation\" project. After more than 20 years of continuous efforts, the project not only profoundly changed the overall appearance of rural Zhejiang but also made pioneering exploration and exemplary guidance for advancing rural revitalization nationwide, serving as a model to learn from and reference. We should study and apply the development concepts, working methods, and promotion mechanisms embodied in the “Ten Million Project,” starting from practical problems that farmers feel strongly about, find accurate entry points for rural revitalization, adapt measures to local conditions and strive for effectiveness, concentrating efforts to accomplish a batch of practical tasks that the masses can tangibly perceive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In advancing comprehensive rural revitalization, we must firmly hold on to two bottom lines: ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale return to poverty. When you hold grain in hand, your heart is at ease. To ensure national food security, efforts must be made both to stabilize planting areas and to increase yield per unit area, effectively motivating farmers to cultivate grain and local governments to enhance grain production. We should diligently promote production of grain and key agricultural products, steadily advance a new round of enhancing grain production capacity by over 100 billion catties, and establish a trinomial protection system for farmland quantity, quality, and ecology. This will ensure grain output remains above 1.3 trillion catties (about 650 million tons), build a diversified food supply system, and further firm up and secure the Chinese “rice bowl.” We must implement monitoring and assistance mechanisms to prevent poverty relapse, strictly fulfill responsibilities for preventing return to poverty, continuously strengthen industrial and employment assistance, increase supportive efforts to key areas, improve development conditions, enhance the “hematopoietic” capacity, and stimulate endogenous motivation to continuously consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, ensuring that large-scale poverty return does not occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, continuous focus must be placed on improving rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance. The countryside is not only the spatial carrier of agricultural production but also the home and native land of countless farmers. We must enhance rural industrial development, promote integrated development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, make good use of local specialty products, uphold the principles of agriculture-driven industry, quality-strengthened agriculture, and green agriculture, and accelerate building a modern rural industrial system combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, integrating production, processing and sales, and blending agriculture with culture and tourism. We must enhance rural construction, strengthen the guiding role of rural planning, adapt to trends in rural population changes, optimize village layout, industrial structure, and public service provision, coordinating new-type urbanization with comprehensive rural revitalization. We must improve rural governance, promote rural revitalization through Party building, flourish rural culture, continuously advance changes in rural customs and habits, uphold and develop the new era “Fengqiao Experience,” and build peaceful rural areas. Only by coordinating rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance and continuously creating a favorable environment where people live and work in peace and contentment can the broad masses of farmers have stronger senses of fulfillment, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Science and technology are powerful tools, and reform is the magic weapon for advancing comprehensive rural revitalization. We must strengthen the dual drive of science and reform, optimize the strategic layout of agricultural scientific and technological innovation, increase efforts to tackle key core technologies in seed sources, reinforce rural reform and innovation, and intensify integration and synergy of reform measures to inject impetus and vitality into rural revitalization. “Good governance depends on wealthy people.” Increasing farmers’ income is the central task of “three rural” work. We must implement farmer income increase promotion actions, continually enlarge rural industries to enrich the people, strengthen industry development linking and benefiting farmers, enhance vocational skills training for migrant workers, promote multi-channel employment of rural labor force, expand income-earning avenues, so that farmers’ pockets get fuller and their quality of life improves steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China and is a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Doing well with “three rural” work is a glorious mission and important responsibility. Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, focus on the goal of building a strong agricultural country, strengthen confidence, work hard with determination, implement the Party Central Committee’s decisions and deployments on “three rural” work with the spirit of “nailing down nails,” continuously achieve new progress in advancing comprehensive rural revitalization, and steadily march toward the goal of building a strong agricultural country.\n",

For example, by the end of 2023, the share of IPv6 traffic in mobile networks is expected to increase from 20% in 2021 to 50%, and the IPv6 concentration in the top 100 commercial Internet applications by user volume should rise from 40% in 2021 to 70%. Industry experts consider that the “Three-Year Action Plan,” by setting quantitative goals addressing key points and pain points of the IPv6 industry, holds important guiding significance for industrial development.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better promote the implementation of the “Three-Year Action Plan,” on August 25, 2021, MIIT convened a national deployment briefing and promotion meeting for the three-year special action on IPv6 traffic promotion. The policy was interpreted and promoted across the entire industry, with representatives from communication administrations of 31 provinces (regions, municipalities), MIIT’s industrial management departments, and over 50 industry enterprise representatives attending. The meeting helped form a consensus and accelerate large-scale IPv6 deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2021, MIIT issued a notice on strengthening and standardizing radio management for the 2400 MHz, 5100 MHz, and 5800 MHz frequency bands, incorporating the IPv6 support status of home wireless routers into the radio type approval monitoring requirements. This measure resolved the “last 100 meters” bottleneck in terminal upgrades for IPv6 traffic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same month, IPv6 standardization efforts entered a new phase. On September 1, 2021, under the guidance of MIIT, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and other departments, the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) took the lead in establishing the IPv6 Standards Working Group. Industry experts believe that the formation of this working group will converge the strengths of industry, academia, research, and application parties, accelerating the domestic and international IPv6 standardization process, which is of great significance to promote IPv6 technology and industry development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, in November 2021, MIIT officially issued the “14th Five-Year Plan for Information and Communications Industry Development,” which clearly stated that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, efforts will be made to enhance the capability of end-to-end IPv6 connectivity, improve IPv6 network performance and service levels, and achieve simultaneous growth in IPv6 user scale and business traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry Collaboration Brings Significant IPv6 Traffic Growth\n",
      "The release of the “Three-Year Action Plan” stimulated the industry’s confidence and enthusiasm to accelerate IPv6 traffic growth. Under strong policy guidance, basic telecom operators, Internet companies, CDN providers, and terminal manufacturers vigorously promoted IPv6 upgrades and transformations in networks, services, and terminals, with the results of large-scale deployment becoming increasingly evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since July 2021, the four major basic telecom operators—China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Broadcasting Network—have further accelerated infrastructure upgrades. On the basis of fully completing IPv6 upgrades of 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband networks, they continued to advance renovations and upgrades of data centers, CDNs, and cloud networks. Combined with the rollout of “Double Giga” and other services, they sped up the replacement of outdated broadband terminals to help boost IPv6 traffic scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Internet enterprises and CDN providers such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and Wangsu Technology continuously promoted the upgrading of cloud, IDC, and CDN infrastructures and increased IPv6 support in related businesses. Companies like ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Meituan, Qihoo 360, and NetEase steadily upgraded their apps to raise IPv6 application concentration, while terminal manufacturers like Xiaomi, H3C, and Jixiang Tengda intensified IPv6 upgrades in their products under sale and in development.\n",
      "\n",
      "With joint efforts from across the industry, China’s IPv6 traffic growth has achieved remarkable results. At the “2021 China IPv6 Innovation Development Conference” held on October 11, 2021, Han Xia, Chief Engineer of MIIT, announced that IPv6 traffic in mobile networks in China had grown from zero to 22.87%, exceeding the annual target ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Latest data show that by the end of 2021, the share of IPv6 traffic in China’s mobile networks rose from 17.21% at the end of 2020 to 35.15%, while fixed network IPv6 traffic share grew from 4.3% to 9.38% during the same period, both achieving year-on-year doubling growth and exceeding set goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration Empowers Initial Formation of the “IPv6+” Innovation System\n",
      "While accelerating large-scale IPv6 deployment, IPv6 innovation also gathered speed. The “Three-Year Action Plan” clearly requires the gradual and orderly advancement of the “IPv6+” network and technology innovations. The “14th Five-Year Plan for Information and Communications Industry Development” explicitly supports pilots and large-scale applications of “IPv6+” innovative technologies in key industries such as finance, energy, transportation, education, and government affairs, enhancing the support capability of IPv6 networks for the digital transformation and upgrading of industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the entire industry accelerated the construction of the “IPv6+” innovation system, and a series of achievements were realized nationwide. At the “IPv6+ Innovation Cities Summit Forum” held on September 10, the “IPv6+ Innovative City” was settled in Shanghai. By 2025, Shanghai aims to build a next-generation information infrastructure system characterized by high speed, mobility, ubiquity, and intelligence and agility. At the “6th IPv6+ Industry Forum” on September 27, SAIC Motor Corporation together with China Telecom released the “IPv6+ Industrial Intelligent Cloud Network Technology White Paper.” In October, Wuhan took the lead nationwide in launching large-scale IPv6 deployment and accelerated the creation of an “IPv6+” digital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accelerate IPv6 integration across various industries, in October 2021, the first “Guanghua Cup” Gigabit Optical Network Application Innovation Competition, guided by MIIT, was officially launched. The competition set “IPv6+” technological innovation applications as an independent track. In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and other departments began pilot projects on IPv6 technology and innovation integration applications to accelerate IPv6-enabled empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the past year, “IPv6+” accelerated implementation in industries such as finance, education, healthcare, and energy, promoting the digital transformation of various sectors. For example, Guangdong Province actively explored the application of “IPv6+” in government extranet and established a provincial-level benchmark for comprehensive scenario “IPv6+” government extranet. State Grid Jibei Power Company was the first in the network to deploy “IPv6+” innovative technologies, significantly enhancing network autonomous decision-making capability and intelligence. China Construction Bank has completed IPv6 upgrades and deployment for more than 90 sets of Internet systems and the core network 2.0 system, and innovatively used “IPv6+” technology to significantly enhance network delivery capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an indispensable “network foundation” in the digital economy era, large-scale IPv6 deployment carries great significance. Currently, China ranks among the world’s leaders in IPv6 users and network scale, and IPv6 traffic and service bearing capacity have also greatly improved. With the comprehensive launch of the “traffic promotion” era, China’s IPv6 development will further accelerate, strongly supporting the digital transformation of thousands of industries and injecting powerful momentum into building a cyber power and strengthening the digital economy.\n",

After 10 Years, the State Council Issues Guiding Documents on the Capital Market Again, Strengthening Supervision to Prevent Risks and Promoting High-Quality Development of the Capital Market—An Exclusive Interview with Wu Qing, Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, on Implementing the Third “National Nine Articles” for the Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the State Council issued the “Several Opinions on Strengthening Supervision, Preventing Risks, and Promoting High-Quality Development of the Capital Market.” This newly released document consists of nine sections and represents the third set of “National Nine Articles” for the capital market. On the 12th, Wu Qing, Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), gave an exclusive interview to reporters regarding the implementation of these opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Council Issues Capital Market Guiding Documents Again After 10 Years\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How should we understand the significance of the issuance of these opinions?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The issuance of these opinions by the State Council deeply implements General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions on the capital market and fulfills the deployment of the Central Financial Work Conference. Following the two previous sets of “National Nine Articles” issued in 2004 and 2014, this is the first time after 10 years that the State Council has released guiding documents on the capital market. It fully demonstrates the high importance and earnest expectations the Party Central Committee and the State Council place on the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the previous two “National Nine Articles,” the newly issued opinions have several main features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. They fully reflect the political nature and people-centered attribute of the capital market. They emphasize adhering to and strengthening the Party’s comprehensive leadership over capital market work, upholding a people-centered value orientation, and more effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. They fully emphasize strong supervision, risk prevention, and the promotion of high-quality development as the main thread. The opinions call for maintaining stability as the baseline, strengthening fundamentals and foundations, enforcing strict supervision and management, and better serving the overall high-quality economic and social development with the capital market’s own high-quality growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. They focus on goal orientation and problem orientation. Particularly, they address the prominent problems exposed in the stock market volatility since August last year, including system mechanisms and regulatory enforcement, by timely filling gaps and reinforcing weak links, responding to investor concerns, solving deep-rooted contradictions accumulated in the capital market over the long term, and accelerating the construction of a safe, standardized, transparent, open, vibrant, and resilient capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Opinions Set Layered Development Goals for the Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How should the capital market development goals proposed in the opinions for the coming period be understood?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed the comprehensive promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through modernization with Chinese characteristics. The Central Financial Work Conference put forward the goal of accelerating the construction of a financial power. A strong capital market is an essential feature of a modern economy. Promoting the high-quality development of the capital market helps facilitate high-level circulation among technology, industry, and capital, improve the modern industrial system, and promote the development of new quality productive forces; enrich financial products and services and create more opportunities to increase residents’ property income; also helps develop equity financing, optimize financing structures, and improve the uniquely Chinese modern financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new “National Nine Articles” focus on modernization with Chinese characteristics as the core and anchor at the goal of building a financial power, proposing phased capital market development goals for the next five years, 2035, and mid-century. These goals outline a blueprint from aspects such as investor protection, quality of listed companies, industry and institutional development, regulatory capability, and governance system construction. We understand that this series of development goals is comprehensive and progressive step by step. We must unswervingly adhere to market-oriented and rule-of-law reforms, respect laws and rules, take steady steps to implement these goals, maintain sustained efforts, and unwaveringly turn the blueprint into reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Opinions’ Implementation Will Form a “1+N” Policy System\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How will the CSRC systematically promote the implementation of the various policy measures proposed in the opinions?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The new “National Nine Articles” adhere to systematic thinking, combining short-term and long-term measures with comprehensive policies. Along with the implementation arrangements organized by the CSRC and relevant parties, these form a “1+N” policy system. The “1” refers to the opinion document itself, while the “N” represents several supporting institutional rules. Last month, we issued four supporting policy documents on strictly controlling the issuance and listing admission gates and strengthening ongoing supervision of listed companies. Today, we will also publish a supporting policy document to strengthen delisting supervision and solicit public comments on six specific institutional rules simultaneously. The stock exchanges will also collect public comments on some self-regulatory rules concurrently. Next, based on in-depth research, we will study and develop reform measures to promote the long-term development of the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main thread of the “1+N” policy system is strong regulation, risk prevention, and promotion of high-quality development. These are complementary and form an organic whole that must be advanced and implemented in a coordinated, systematic manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of strong supervision, we will build an all-around, three-dimensional capital market regulatory system that fully implements a regulatory framework with “teeth and thorns” and clear edges. Listed company supervision will emphasize whole-chain supervision and enhancing investment value, focusing continuously on strict admission, strict ongoing supervision, and stronger delisting enforcement. Institutional supervision will drive institutions back to their origins, making them better and stronger, further fulfilling gatekeeper responsibilities, guiding securities, futures, and fund institutions to correct business philosophies, raise compliance levels, professional service capabilities, and core competitiveness. We will actively cultivate rational investment, value investment, long-term investment concepts, and a healthy investment culture. Trading supervision will promote fairness and efficiency, regulate the trading conduct of various entities and funds, severely crack down on illegal and disruptive behaviors, and maintain open, fair, and just market order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding risk prevention, we will propose a series of mechanism arrangements and policy measures from the perspectives of maintaining market stability, preventing and resolving risks in key areas, improving expectation management mechanisms, and balancing openness and safety. Particularly, we aim to enhance the capital market’s intrinsic stability, improve risk monitoring and disposal mechanisms, and focus on stabilizing confidence and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote high-quality development, we will earnestly implement the requirements of the Central Financial Work Conference to advance financial reform in five major aspects, further improve the multi-level capital market system, enhance the adaptability and inclusiveness of capital market systems, promote capital formation to better serve new industries, new business formats, and new technologies, and effectively promote the development of new quality productive forces. Currently, we are conducting a comprehensive assessment of capital market reforms, widely soliciting opinions and suggestions, improving related institutional rules, and pushing forward deepening major reforms such as the stock issuance registration system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forming Effective Governance of the Capital Market Through Joint Construction, Shared Management, and Shared Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Promoting high-quality development of the capital market requires combined efforts from all parties. What arrangements does the opinion include in this regard?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: There are many participants in the capital market, and its operating mechanisms are complex. In a good market ecology, institutional investors and individual investors grow together; long-term and short-term funds each find their place; issuers and investors achieve mutual success; all market participants perform their responsibilities; and healthy interaction occurs between supervision and the market. This requires all related parties to work together to properly handle the balanced relationships among financing and investment, primary and secondary markets, market entry and exit, on-exchange and off-exchange, and other aspects, forming effective governance based on joint construction, shared management, and shared benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new “National Nine Articles” includes many specific arrangements on these key points. For example, promoting long-term funds entering the market emphasizes not only vigorously developing equity public funds as the “basic plate” but also creating a policy environment that attracts, retains, and nurtures such funds, promoting the entry of insurance funds, social security funds, pension funds, and other long-term capital with tailored deployment. Another example is the emphasis on strengthening the rule of law, significantly increasing the cost of violations in the capital market, and improving administrative, criminal, and civil multi-dimensional accountability systems, proposing many tough measures. We believe that as long as these efforts persist, the capital market will become increasingly sound and orderly. The opinions also demand deepening coordination and linkage between central and local governments and among ministries and commissions. We will continue to strengthen coordination with all relevant sectors and promote the formation of strong joint forces to support the capital market’s high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a Politically Solid, Competently Skilled, and Strictly Disciplined “Iron Army” of Regulators\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: The opinions also require strengthening the construction of the CSRC itself, and related documents have been issued. Could you elaborate on specific measures in this regard?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: One must be strong oneself to forge strong iron. The new “National Nine Articles” clearly require strengthening the regulatory team’s own building, and we have already made arrangements. We will further emphasize political construction, continuously consolidate and expand results from the thematic education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply promote strict Party governance in all respects, and comprehensively implement strict supervision and management with inward-looking determination. Comprehensive strictness in self-construction will drive comprehensive strictness in regulatory work. We will strengthen coordination and linkage with the disciplinary inspection and supervision team stationed in the commission and steadily promote rectifications from central inspections, focusing on eradicating the conditions that breed corruption, and simultaneously promote the “dare not, cannot, and do not want to” corruption prevention mechanism. Regarding highly concerned issues such as the “revolving door” between government and business and evasive resignations, we have introduced more than 20 measures, combining business and management-end comprehensive interventions, with further deepened special governance to carry through resolutely without toleration. In summary, we will strive to build a politically robust, capable, and disciplined iron regulatory team, providing strong assurance for strict regulation, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development of the capital market.\n",

      "Dr. Wong Yat Wah, head of the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Department at Queen Mary Hospital, formerly served as the Deputy Hospital Chief Executive. During his involvement in hospital administration, he worked on providing better and faster medical services to the public, making significant contributions. The waiting time for new cases at the orthopaedic specialist outpatient clinics within the Hong Kong West Cluster has stabilized, decreasing from over 160 weeks in 2018 to around 90 weeks recently. Nearly half of the patients can secure appointments within 16 to 20 weeks. Dr. Wong stated that the hospital prioritizes patients based on the severity of their conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients visiting the hospital may require consultations across multiple specialties. Through one-stop clinics, nurse follow-ups for discharged patients, and flexible allocation of surgical and specialist outpatient staff, Dr. Wong explained that such coordinated efforts reduce the number of clinic visits patients need to make, which in turn effectively shortens their waiting times.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, when patients showed possible orthopaedic symptoms, Dr. Wong said, “We would send someone over, but going back and forth wasted a lot of time.” Since 2021, they have piloted cross-specialty joint video consultations, involving family medicine doctors and orthopaedic doctors providing clinical advice to patients via video calls. After assessment, non-urgent cases are followed up by family medicine specialist clinics, while severe cases are directly referred to orthopaedic outpatient clinics. “We can see many more patients, and with the press of a button, we can connect for consultations,” he said.\n",

      "Master Zhao Yuanchao presented a report titled \"Music Rising in Chang’an — Reflections on Urban Order and Characteristics,\" delving into the synergy between urban development and architectural design, and how innovative design concepts promote continuous cultural and historical heritage. He proposed that architectural design no longer focuses solely on the function and aesthetics of a single building but places more emphasis on its role in the overall urban space. This design philosophy urges architects to consider the relationship with the surrounding environment and how to reflect and strengthen the cultural characteristics of the city when creating new buildings. He mentioned that modern architecture should reflect locality while regional architecture should be modernized, a concept realized in many projects in Xi’an. As a city rich in historical culture, Xi’an should bring new vitality and functions through appropriate design and planning without damaging traditional styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chang’an Music project is an integrated cultural and arts center blending culture, art, leisure, commerce, and ecology. Inspired by the traditional musical instrument \"Xun,\" its abstract form has been incorporated into the architectural design, giving the complex a unique cultural character and aiming to become a new cultural landmark in Xi’an. The total construction area is 143,000 square meters, including a grand theater with 2,049 seats, a 1,500-seat concert hall, a 511-seat multifunctional hall, and a 650-seat cinema. These facilities not only meet diversified cultural performance needs but also support various meetings and social events, demonstrating a multifunctional design concept.\n",

      "On September 5th, reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that by August, various crops across the province had successively matured. Agricultural and rural departments at all levels had proactively planned and arranged measures to ensure agricultural machinery services, seized favorable weather conditions, and orderly carried out autumn harvesting and planting work, laying a solid foundation for achieving bumper grain production and harvests. As of August 28th, the total harvested area of various crops in the province reached 68,300 hectares, completing one-eighth of the total sowing tasks. Among these, grain crops accounted for 37,400 hectares, oil crops 16,500 hectares, and vegetables 14,300 hectares. The province also replanted a cumulative area of 12,800 hectares of vegetables, forage, and other crops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs made early plans and deployments, with responsibilities firmly assigned at all levels to ensure all intended planting and replanting tasks were completed. They promoted the implementation of yield-increasing measures, formulated guiding documents such as the \"Notice on the Implementation of Integrated Pest Management Projects for Crops in 2023,\" the \"Action Plan for Enhancing Grain and Oil Crop Yields through the Cultivation of New Agricultural Business Entities,\" and \"Scientific Use and Recycling of Plastic Mulch.\" Focusing on the goal of increasing grain and oil crop yields, they implemented farmer-benefiting policies, supported the meticulous execution of key technical measures across regions, and accelerated the improvement of quality and efficiency in grain and oilseed production.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the mechanization level of farming operations was enhanced. Agricultural and rural departments at all levels focused on promoting high-efficiency and green agricultural machinery equipment, continuously advancing the mechanization level of autumn grain harvesting.

      " Flip Camera Smartphones  \n",
      " Because in most phones the rear cameras produce far better images than the front ones, yet users have a strong demand for selfies using the front camera, how can manufacturers fit a larger sensor into the front camera within the limited phone space while keeping costs under control?  \n",
      " In September 2013, OPPO released a smartphone equipped with a camera module capable of rotating freely up to 206 degrees — the OPPO N1. This phone had only one 13-megapixel rear camera, but by rotating the camera module, the rear camera could also serve as a front-facing selfie camera. As a result, this phone was quite popular among female consumers at the time.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Phones with the Most Cameras  \n",
      " The Nokia 9 PureView features five cameras, arranged evenly along with a flash and proximity sensor, which led many to mistakenly believe it had seven cameras in total. Unlike other multi-camera phone setups, all five cameras share the same specifications, each equipped with a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/1.8 lens. Of these, only two are color cameras while the other three are monochrome. When taking photos, the five cameras shoot simultaneously at different exposures and merge the images into one high-quality photo. This system was developed through Nokia’s cooperation with Light, the maker of the Light L16 camera, and uses Light’s Lux camera control chip to manage the five cameras. Theoretically, this setup can capture photos with richer details and colors. However, in practice, users experienced slow photo processing speeds and sometimes required computer software to fully realize the shooting effects, which created some awkward user experiences.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Pop-up Camera Smartphones  \n",
      " At one point, the mobile phone industry was fiercely debating between punch-hole displays and full-screen displays. At this moment, OPPO offered a new solution — the pop-up camera module.  \n",
      " The Find X, released by OPPO in June 2018, is a full-screen smartphone whose hallmark is that the front and rear camera modules are combined into one component embedded inside the phone body, which mechanically pops up and retracts. When not in use, the camera module is completely hidden inside the body, allowing the Find X to have a truly full-screen display without any punch-hole and extremely narrow bezels on the top and bottom. In its retracted state, the back of the Find X is a solid piece of glass, smooth and elegant like jade. This design is minimalistic and bold, representing a very daring attempt.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Camera-Style Smartphones  \n",
      " In 2013, Samsung broke new ground by launching a smartphone that looked like a compact camera from the back but was indistinguishable from other phones at the front — the Galaxy S4 Zoom. It was developed based on the Galaxy S4 mini and added a feature unmatched by any other smartphone on the market: a 10x (24-240mm) optical image stabilized zoom lens with a 1/2.33-inch, 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor. The 10x optical zoom lens extends outward like a compact camera lens during shooting, providing the feel of holding and operating a camera.  \n",
      " Although the Galaxy S4 Zoom seemed like a reasonable and creative phone, limited by the Android system and hardware capabilities at the time, it didn’t fulfill people’s dream of replacing traditional cameras with phone cameras. Samsung eventually abandoned plans to produce more such devices, which is somewhat regrettable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Innovations in Mobile Phone Screen Technology  \n",
      " 3D Glasses-Free Smartphones  \n",
      " The camera brand RED created the first mainstream 4K digital cinema camera, the RED One. Later, with their “Weapon” series, they ventured into 8K cameras and gained widespread recognition among professionals, becoming a leading brand for Hollywood film production equipment.  \n",
      " In 2018, RED launched the massive and bulky smartphone RED Hydrogen One. This phone boasted top-tier specifications at the time, featuring a glasses-free 3D holographic display, a large-capacity battery, a unique ripple-patterned frame, and modular expansion connectors for professional camera accessories. The rear cover was also designed with strong aesthetics. Its appearance shared the same lineage as RED’s cameras—distinctive, solid, and heavy. However, its core selling point — the glasses-free 3D display — received heavy criticism due to the limited applicable scenarios and lack of adequate content.  \n",
      " Following the lukewarm market response to the RED Hydrogen One, RED had to shelve their plans to continue making smartphones and refocused their efforts on developing high-end imaging equipment.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Projector Smartphones  \n",
      " Since phone screens are limited in size, how can users freely enlarge their display for a better experience or conveniently share their screen content with friends nearby? Samsung addressed this with the Galaxy Beam, the first smartphone supporting projection function, released in 2012. The device ran Android 2.3 and featured a projector module at the top that could project phone content with a brightness of 15 lumens and a maximum image size of 50 inches.  \n",
      " In 2012, such a portable mini projector certainly attracted many consumers. However, constrained by the projector module’s size that couldn’t be further reduced, the phone’s thickness reached 12.5mm. The 15-lumen brightness was nearly invisible in daylight and only barely usable in extremely dark environments. These limitations restricted the product’s practicality and led to its gradual phase-out from the market.  \n",
      "\n",
      " E-ink Screen Smartphones  \n",
      " The YOTA dual-screen phone featured two displays: a normal color screen on the front and an e-ink screen similar to those used on e-readers on the back. It was the world’s first dual-screen and first e-ink screen phone. Originating from Russia, YOTA developed the YOTA3 dual-screen phone in collaboration with Chinese companies.  \n",
      " The idea behind using two types of screens was to extend battery life. In certain usage scenarios such as reading news, emails, or web pages, the more power-efficient e-ink screen could be used. The color screen would only be used for watching videos or browsing images.  \n",
      " However, this design was controversial from the very first generation of YOTA phones. Coupled with hardware that was not flagship level, the YOTA phones eventually became niche products that failed to find a foothold in the fiercely competitive Chinese phone market.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Dual-Screen Smartphones  \n",
      " LG made many attempts exploring multi-screen smartphones. It once released the LG V50 ThinQ, a dual-screen phone resembling a foldable phone by adding an external expandable screen accessory. This dual-screen form gained a following among some gamers who appreciated the ability to split the game screen and controls across the two screens.  \n",
      " Later, LG introduced the LG Wing which had two built-in screens, with one capable of rotating 90 degrees. The design was inspired by the swivel slide phones of the feature phone era. This combination allowed you to use different functions on the two screens in different orientations—for example, when taking photos, the horizontal screen could be used for framing the shot and the vertical screen for adjusting camera settings; during gaming, the horizontal screen displayed the game while the vertical screen handled controls.  \n",
      " In practice, many apps were not adapted to this format, causing various malfunctions or even making some apps unusable. This was among the key reasons the LG Wing eventually disappeared from the market.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Innovations in Mobile Phone Form Factor  \n",
      " Flexible Screen Wristwatch Phones  \n",
      " In 2019, Nubia unveiled at the MWC conference in Barcelona its pioneering “wristwatch phone” — Nubia Alpha. Its core innovation was the use of flexible screen technology. Nubia believed that future smartphones would gradually merge with wearable devices, and the Nubia Alpha was designed with this in mind. It featured a long, narrow 4.01-inch flexible OLED display with a resolution of 960×192 and was worn on the wrist like a bracelet.  \n",
      " The Nubia Alpha was an exploration of future phone form factors. However, its unusual form was incompatible with mainstream software, and combined with unfamiliar user interactions and an odd appearance, it deterred many consumers.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Smartphones With Physical Keyboards  \n",
      " At the first iPhone launch, Steve Jobs mocked traditional smartphones with various physical keyboards and ushered in an era where on-screen virtual keyboards replaced physical ones. Yet BlackBerry, which was later overwhelmed by iPhone and Android phones, continued to release smartphones with physical keyboards.  \n",
      " The BlackBerry Passport was distinctive mainly due to its rare square-shaped screen combined with a full physical keyboard, giving it a bulky look. Released in 2015, once the touchscreen era began, its momentum was unstoppable. Consumers showed little interest in the BlackBerry Passport with its physical keyboard, and it became the last BlackBerry phone running their own OS. From then on, BlackBerry shifted to using Android as its operating system.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Final Thoughts  \n",
      " This overview recalled some of the more distinctive and groundbreaking smartphones in history. Some design concepts remain unique even today, and some are sadly missed. Technology progresses through countless explorations and trials, maturing only after numerous failures. Let us remember these devices and continue to witness the truly innovative smartphones of the future.\n",

Did your dad say something to you?” She put down her phone and complained, “I was just curious and flipped through the toolbox a little, and he said I was getting in the way.” I tried to console her: “Then let’s just take a break—as if we’re all that interested in watching him anyway.” Still indignant, my daughter pointed at the kitten and said, “But the cat gets to climb right into the toolbox, and Dad just keeps saying how cute it is.

      "(From our reporter) The Municipal Party Committee Central Group held a study session yesterday, listening to a special lecture on “Implementing New Development Concepts to Promote High-Quality Development” delivered by Professor Lu Ming, Distinguished Professor at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Li Qiang, the Party Secretary, presided over the meeting and pointed out that we must adhere to Xi Jinping’s Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our guide, accurately grasp the practical connotations of implementing new development concepts and achieving high-quality development, integrate the “four judging by” orientation throughout, continuously inspire the vitality and momentum for high-quality development, and accelerate the construction of a socialist modern international metropolis with global influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Lu Ming’s lecture focused on understanding the new stage of development, implementing new development concepts, and forming a new development pattern. Combining theory with practice, and using specific comparative data and vivid case analyses, he elaborated from three aspects: new trends in the new stage of development, high-quality development under new development concepts, and Shanghai’s development in the new stage and pattern, and also offered recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Qiang pointed out that we must deeply understand that high-quality development embodies the new development concepts: innovation as the primary driving force, coordination as an intrinsic feature, green development as the universal form, openness as the only path, and sharing as the fundamental purpose. In light of Shanghai's realities, we must make strengthening core functions the central focus of high-quality development, maintain relatively rapid economic growth as the premise for strengthening functionalities and service outreach, promote steady qualitative improvements alongside reasonable quantitative growth, and strive to lead the nation in high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Qiang emphasized that to promote high-quality development, we must continuously stimulate vitality and momentum for growth, and vigorously advance changes in momentum, efficiency, and quality. We must continuously deepen high-level reform and opening-up, focus on improving resource allocation efficiency, smoothing economic circulation, and strengthening effective incentives, continually expand the breadth and depth of reforms, shift from openness based on the flow of goods and factors toward openness based on rules and institutions, and create a business environment of international excellence. Guided by national strategic tasks such as the Pudong Leading Zone, Lingang New Area, Yangtze River Delta Integrated Demonstration Zone, and Hongqiao International Open Hub, we should strengthen the integrated system of reforms, conduct higher-level opening-up stress tests, and provide institutional innovation test fields to support high-quality development. It is essential to cultivate and grow new economic growth drivers, and vigorously advance the development of new technologies, new industries, new models, and new business formats. We must accelerate the development of the “3+6” modern industrial system, expand and strengthen industries such as integrated circuits, biomedicine, and artificial intelligence, elevate their level, seize new positions in digital economy and green low-carbon fields, focus on intelligent connected vehicles, and implement end-user-driven strategies, striving for the initiative in high-quality development. It is important to build high-level talent hubs, further highlight international talent orientation, build world-class talent platforms, implement more open talent policies, foster a high-quality talent ecosystem, and provide an inexhaustible source of momentum for high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Qiang stressed the need to firmly establish the orientation of “judging heroes by per-acre yield, by efficiency, by energy consumption, and by environmental impact,” and accelerate the transformation of development models. We should work on increasing economic density and improve input-output efficiency; vigorously develop capital-intensive, technology-intensive, and knowledge-intensive industries and enterprises. We must identify key strengths in the “five types of economy,” continuously increase the concentration of scientific and technological innovation, expand brand influence, concentrate key elements of flow, and raise the penetration rate of the digital economy. We should focus on upgrading industrial levels, strive to take the initiative in the global industrial supply chain and value chain allocation pattern, better integrate upstream and downstream, production, supply, and sales, and improve the supply of key core technologies. Efforts should also be made to promote the low-carbon transition, accelerate adjustments to industrial and energy structures, improve energy efficiency, and advance green finance. To improve ecological and environmental quality, we must uphold the principles of ecological priority and green development, fight the tough battle of pollution prevention and control, implement eco-benefit projects, expand urban green capacity, accelerate the implementation of the “Thousand Parks Plan,” expedite construction of ring-city ecological park belts, and intensively advance the development of Chongming into a world-class ecological island.\n",

      "Whether in theory or in practice, new quality productive forces are an intellectual achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive systems, and determine the course of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the scientific concept of “new quality productive forces” during his inspection in Heilongjiang, and has since elaborated on it on multiple occasions, particularly providing a systematic exposition during a collective study session of the Central Political Bureau. In general, the proposal of new quality productive forces is an innovation and development of the Marxist theory of productive forces, the latest achievement of Xi Jinping’s economic thought, an innovative core concept of the political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a clarion call at a crucial moment in advancing Chinese modernization, and a strategic deployment for nation-building and national rejuvenation. Both in theory and in practice, new quality productive forces represent an intellectual achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive systems, and determine the course of history. To deepen our understanding, several perspectives and entry points must be grasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it should be understood from the classic Marxist political economy definition of productive forces. In classical Marxism, laborers, means of production, and objects of labor constitute the three elements of productive forces. The historical development and dialectical unfolding of these three elements contain the developmental logic of new quality productive forces. From economic and technological development practices, we can see that objects of labor are related to new materials and new energy, means of production are related to informatization, artificial intelligence, high-end precision equipment, etc., and laborers are related to specialized talents and industrial teams in the era of informatization and intelligence—this can also be understood in connection with Lenin’s discussion on labor productivity. The comprehensive permeation of science and technology into productive force elements and the improvement of labor productivity are natural extensions of the innovation of productive force elements. Marx saw means of production as the primary marker distinguishing historical eras and discussed the differences between the hand mill and the steam engine; in fact, both objects of labor and laborers have definitive qualitative characteristics of their times. Lenin saw labor productivity as the fundamental criterion by which socialism surpasses capitalism; essentially, he incorporated science and technology into the system of productive forces. This teaches us that every era has its own new quality productive forces; therefore, the concept of new quality productive forces is a universally meaningful concept that can be fully integrated into the Marxist political economy and productive forces theoretical system, possessing major theoretical significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it should be understood from the historical process of theoretical innovation by our Party since the reform and opening-up. In the most general sense, the theory of productive forces is a theory about development. Since the reform and opening-up, our Party has achieved a series of major innovative results in productive forces theory through painstaking theoretical and practical exploration. On the new journey of building a strong nation and national rejuvenation, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s introduction of the concept of new quality productive forces marks a major synthesis and integration in our Party’s productive forces theory. Placing new quality productive forces within this continuous pedigree allows us to understand its historical significance more deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it should be understood from the perspective of the ever-changing technological revolution. The technological revolution and the profound changes it brings are the main theme of our times. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s proposal of new quality productive forces is a highly condensed summary and innovative development of historical experience, reflecting a new level of understanding by our Party regarding the technological revolution and its laws. The focus of new quality productive forces is on “newness,” the key is “quality.” Productive forces provide the general theoretical connotation, while “new” and “quality” are the propositions and special requirements of the era. Together, they form an organic body of theoretical innovation, encompassing both the general requirements of developing productive forces and the special requirements of seizing the opportunities presented by the technological revolution. It points out the bottlenecks and shortcomings in China’s modernization and specifies the focus and path for solving these problems. This theoretical achievement of new quality productive forces enriches and completes the value function of Chinese-style modernization, enabling us to deeply appreciate the power of leadership thought, the theoretical courage and sense of mission of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the era significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, it should be understood from the world structure of major power competition and Sino-US rivalry. Major power competition is a movement of power, with various forces interacting, waxing and waning, pulling and balancing, shaping the world pattern of a given era, in which some major power relationships play a decisive role. Science and technology, especially high-tech, determine the destiny of humanity and the rise and fall of nations—they are truly of paramount national importance and cannot be overlooked. In the early years after the founding of New China, the focus was on nuclear technology, and we developed the “two bombs and one satellite” from a poor and weak foundation. Today, it is information technology, artificial intelligence, new materials, new energy, life sciences, etc.—in which we are catching up, but there is still a long way to go. Major power competition is not just about scale but also quality, not only about total amount but also structure, not just about stock but also incremental growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, it should be understood from the dialectical movement of the productive forces and relations of production. Productive forces and relations of production, as a contradiction, are fundamental Marxist concepts of social movement; they exist in an ongoing dialectical movement, and the transformation of relations of production to liberate and develop productive forces is the basic method for transforming society. Revolution, reform, development, modernization—this is a grand project. Over the past 40 years, it is precisely through reform and opening-up—China’s key move in determining its fate—that we have changed the face of China, its people, the Chinese nation, and even the world. Cultivating and developing new quality productive forces requires the critical move of reform and opening-up even more. Currently, there remain many systemic and structural obstacles affecting and constraining talent cultivation, scientific and technological innovation, and the development of new quality productive forces. There are widespread and pressing concerns about talent training models, science and technology management systems, innovation environments, achievement evaluation systems, intellectual property protection, and scientific and technological openness. The proposal of new quality productive forces provides us with a rare historical opportunity and practical entry point to solve these problems and advance higher-quality reform and higher-level openness. Embedded within is superb leadership and methodological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, it should be understood in light of the new journey toward building a modern, strong country and achieving the Second Centenary Goal. The historic completion of the First Centenary Goal has laid a solid foundation and historical starting point for realizing the grand blueprint outlined at the 20th Party Congress. The proposal of new quality productive forces provides a new logical starting point and theoretical pillar for the new journey. China has ranked as the world’s second-largest economy for many years, but many industries are still at the mid- and low end of global value chains, with gaps mainly in core competitiveness. Today’s international competition is competition in science and technology, and in talent; essentially, it is competition in the level of high-quality productive forces. The technologically advanced are strong, and those with better quality prevail. The proposal of new quality productive forces sounds the bugle call for high-quality development.\n",

      "On June 24, excitement filled the Yangwa Ship Lock on the North Canal. The event of “Canal Chant” kicked off the inauguration ceremony for the opening of passenger boats between the Beijing and Hebei sections of the Grand Canal. From then on, 62 kilometers of the Beijing-Hebei section of the Grand Canal became interconnected, making “Canal Boat Tour+” themed routes between the two regions a reality and becoming a microcosm of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei’s coordinated development.\n",

      "Hebei has taken the lead in the country in formulating the “Great Wall National Cultural Park (Hebei Section) Construction and Protection Plan,” promulgating and implementing the “Hebei Great Wall Protection Regulations,” and innovatively releasing and implementing the “Hebei Great Wall Scenic Route Construction Guide.” As a key construction area for the Great Wall National Cultural Park, Hebei has 10 major projects included in the Park’s construction and protection plan. By the end of 2021, 34 key projects, including the Shanhaiguan China Great Wall Cultural Museum, had begun construction, with a cumulative investment of 7.423 billion yuan, providing “Hebei experience” for national cultural park construction.\n",

      "The world watched the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Hebei culture and tourism system completed the assistance and upgrade of contracted hotels in the Zhangjiakou Competition Zone during the Winter Olympics, provided accommodation guarantees, hosted performances for the opening and closing ceremonies, and organized cultural activities in the Zhangjiakou Competition Zone. They created and launched a large number of artistic works themed on the Winter Olympics and held a series of themed activities, actively contributing the power of culture and tourism. In April this year, the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism was honored as an “Outstanding Collective for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics” by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, becoming the pride of all culture and tourism workers in Hebei. In the post-Olympic era, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou sports-culture-tourism belt is advancing rapidly, and the Olympic legacy is providing new opportunities for Hebei’s culture and tourism development.\n",

      "\n",
      "In recent days, staff at Lianxiang Taihang Water Town in Yi County, Baoding have been exceptionally busy, with tourists who have reserved countryside camping projects arriving in an endless stream. The Water Town nestles west of the scenic Yishui Lake, north of the UNESCO World Heritage Site—West Qing Tombs, and south of the red landmark Langya Mountain. The first Hebei Province Tourism Industry Development Conference in 2016 put Yi County’s all-region tourism on the fast track.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood that the innovative Tourism Industry Development Conference platform established by Hebei has continuously enriched the supply of tourism products, improved the public tourism service system, and promoted a comprehensive leap in the quality and efficiency of the tourism industry. The conference has become a vital engine for Hebei to implement new development concepts and accelerate building itself into a powerful tourism province, as well as a significant platform for driving comprehensive regional development. To date, Hebei has held six consecutive provincial-level tourism industry development conferences and more than 60 city-level ones, launching signature all-region tourism clusters such as the No.1 Scenic Avenue, Hutuo River Ecological Corridor, and the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Sports and Culture Tourism Belt, which have become popular “internet celebrity” check-in destinations recommended by numerous netizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistics show that from 2016 to 2019, the total number of tourists in Hebei grew at an average annual rate of 19%, total tourism revenue grew at 26% per year, and total tourism investment grew by 32.6% annually, all ranking among the top in the nation.

      "\n",
      "To fully advance the construction of the “Blessed Land near Beijing, Enjoy Hebei” culture and tourism brand system, Hebei’s Department of Culture and Tourism has established a five-element matrix—brands, media, resources, market, and activities. Brands such as “So Close, So Beautiful—Weekend Tours in Hebei” have continuously been recognized as national typical cases in domestic tourism promotion. Since 2020, facing the impact of the pandemic on culture and tourism, Hebei has continued to empower its tourism market, launching publicity campaigns like “Hebei Invitation,” “Great Wall Appointment,” and “Love My Hometown, Tour Hebei,” releasing a variety of specialty tourism products and measures to benefit the people.\n",

      "There are many private Chinese medicine clinics in Hong Kong, and Chinese medicine practitioners generally have extensive outpatient experience. However, opportunities for them to gain practical experience in hospital wards are relatively limited. Lam Pui Yan, Vice President of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, pointed out that although there are nearly 10,000 Chinese medicine practitioners in the city, relatively few have worked in the public healthcare system. As a result, most are not very familiar with ward environments, methods of collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine, or clinical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chinese medicine practitioners with practical hospital experience are rare in Hong Kong,” Lam said. Although relevant talent can be brought in from the Mainland, this is only a temporary measure. In the long run, local talent in this area must be cultivated. “We should leverage the experience of senior Chinese medicine practitioners from the Mainland to help train Hong Kong’s practitioners, and this training should not only impart knowledge and skills, but also involve practice in an appropriate environment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lam noted that Chinese medicine practitioners must first be allowed to work and undergo training in public hospital wards. “If training relies only on face-to-face teaching or textbooks, it’s impossible to produce Chinese medicine practitioners with practical experience. After all, medicine is a clinical, hands-on profession, and book learning alone is insufficient,” she said. At present, three local universities offer full-time Bachelor’s degrees in Chinese medicine, and students are required to complete several months of clinical placement in Mainland Chinese hospitals. “We hope that, in the future, students can train in Hospital Authority wards in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the curriculum should include content on how Chinese and Western medicine can collaborate, as well as training on relevant examinations, to enrich the clinical experience of the new generation of Chinese medicine students.”\n",

      "They helped homeowners recover housing maintenance funds that had been dormant for ten years, exposed the truth behind a faked lawsuit involving millions in corporate payment, and cut off a money laundering chain disguised as discounted “slow top-up” phone bills... Through these tangible accomplishments achieved through casework, the Shouguang City Procuratorate in Shandong Province has won genuine praise from the public. The procuratorate’s chief procurator, Song Jiaode, stated: “We will continue to focus on practical measures to serve the people through prosecution, address the urgent and difficult concerns of the masses, and use the power of the rule of law to protect their rights and interests.”\n",

      "Resolving a Decade-Old Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, frequent elevator failures occurred in a residential community. After residents submitted repair requests, the property management informed them that the developer had not transferred the designated residential maintenance funds into the special regulatory account managed by the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Department, so the repair costs for the elevators would have to be borne by the homeowners themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ten years ago, 22 homeowners had already paid these funds to the developer when purchasing their homes—so why should they pay again? After repeated attempts by Zhang and the other residents to communicate with the developer failed, their efforts to defend their rights stalled. Subsequently, they sought help at the 12309 Procuratorate Service Center of Shouguang. Prosecutor Zhang Yongzhi, who received them, suggested that they could file a lawsuit in their own names.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the court ruled in favor of the homeowners, the developer still failed to comply with the judgment. The Shouguang Procuratorate continued to supervise and coordinate with the court and relevant departments. Ultimately, the court used the developer’s pre-deposited property quality guarantee funds in the Finance Bureau as the enforcement target and promptly transferred them to the designated account for housing maintenance funds, supporting the homeowners’ claims and avoiding escalation of the dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this case, the procuratorate issued a prosecutorial recommendation for governance to the Housing Department, urging the improvement of housing maintenance funds management mechanisms, strengthening digital supervision, and increasing policy publicity. The Housing Department then upgraded its digital management system and carried out policy promotion, fostering more standardized and orderly use of the maintenance funds.\n",

      "\n",
      "In April 2023, the civil prosecution department discovered clues to a case, leading to the exposure of a nearly one-million-yuan fake lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, a trading company signed a steel supply contract with a construction company, agreeing to supply specified brands. During delivery, the construction company found some steel brands did not match the contract and asked for replacement. However, the trading company’s head, Yang, did not deliver the 53 tons of missing steel; instead, he colluded with project manager Liu to forge fake receipts and inflate the debt by 450,000 yuan, then sued in court in June 2022. The court ruled for the trading company, ordering the construction company to pay over 950,000 yuan, including the 53 tons of undelivered steel. With no appeal, the judgment was executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the surface, this was a regular civil dispute, but the submitted delivery receipts and supply records were inconsistent, especially the claim the goods were delivered when they weren’t. That strongly suggested a fake lawsuit,” said prosecutor Cao Weidong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors reviewed the full file, interviewed key witnesses, and confirmed that Yang had forged receipts to increase the claim and fraudulently win the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fake lawsuits not only damage other enterprises but also erode judicial credibility. Yang’s actions led to factual errors in the judgment and harmed the legitimate rights of the other company. In May 2023, the Shouguang Procuratorate requested Weifang Procuratorate file a protest. In August, Weifang Procuratorate submitted the protest to the intermediate court. In November, the court ordered a retrial, and in July 2024, the retrial reduced the judgment amount by nearly 400,000 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of the fake lawsuit, prosecutors also issued recommendations to the court. The trading company was fined 100,000 yuan, and Yang was judicially detained for fifteen days, powerfully deterring litigation dishonesty.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2024, while handling a case of concealing criminal proceeds, prosecutors in Shouguang discovered that criminal gangs were using “slow top-up platforms”: they attracted customers with low prices, then funneled illicit money from telecom fraud, gambling, etc., in batches into users’ accounts, finally moving it out as virtual currency—a full chain for “turning black money into white.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with challenges like anonymity and dispersed funds, the procuratorate used big data for tracing funds, and formed a task force with police and financial regulators. They spent months to secure key evidence, successfully prosecuted 11 suspects, and recovered more than 4 million yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Criminals exploit people’s desire for bargains, laundering illegal funds by topping up phone or electricity accounts, and even extending this to utility bills, fuel cards, shopping cards, game coins, and live-stream rewards, creating great harm,” said prosecutor Bu Xianhui.\n",
      "\n",
      "To crack down on this hard-to-investigate crime chain, the team used big data analytics to trace every layer of platform transactions, precisely determining where the illicit money went.

      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City is located in the southern part of Nanchang County, Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, with a total planned area of 33.82 square kilometers. It is a key direction for open economic development at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. In recent years, Nanchang City has earnestly implemented new development concepts, proactively integrated into the “Belt and Road” Initiative, seized the opportunity brought by the State Council’s approval of the Jiangxi Inland Open Economic Pilot Zone, closely followed the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee’s new requirements for comprehensive openness, and fully leveraged Xiangtang Town’s excellent railway resources and locational advantages. Every effort has been made to build Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City into a “national land port opening pilot demonstration zone, Jiangxi’s ‘Three Consistencies’ experimental development innovation zone, and a railway logistics cluster area of the Greater Nanchang Metropolitan Circle,” demonstrating Nanchang’s commitment and responsibility.\n",

The station features a bi-directional, hybrid, three-level, seven-yard system, consisting of two main systems: the upbound (second-level, four yards) and downbound (third-level, three yards) yards, totaling 139 tracks throughout the station. At present, Xiangtang West Station handles the daily classification and marshalling of over 17,000 freight railcars. Major trunk railways—including the Beijing-Kowloon, Shanghai-Kunming, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Xiangtang-Putian lines—converge here; National Highways 105, 316, and 320 run through the region; expressways such as Shanghai-Kunming, Jiangxi-Guangdong, Fuzhou-Yinchuan, and Changning provide fast connections, forming a comprehensive and interactive transportation network. Seventy percent of goods from southern Jiangxi enter Nanchang through Xiangtang, and are dispatched from Xiangtang to the rest of China, making it a crucial logistics node and distribution center for Jiangxi and central China.\n",

      "Ambitious and Open Planning Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "Jiangxi Province has clearly proposed to accelerate the construction of Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City. During the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, it aims to develop “three major sections and sixteen functional zones” (High-End Services Section, Advanced Manufacturing Section, Modern Logistics Section; Railway Port, Railway Logistics Base, Commercial Vehicle Logistics Area, Comprehensive Bonded Area, Port Logistics Area, Cold Chain Logistics Area, E-commerce Logistics Area, Express City Distribution Area, Highway Freight Area, Trade Warehousing and Distribution Area, Strategic Reserve Area, Science & Innovation Headquarters Base, International Trade Exhibition Corridor, Health & Leisure Riverside Area, High-Quality Talent Residence Circle, and Port-Adjacent Manufacturing Park). This will form the development layout of “One core for synergy, one corridor for city leadership, one river vein threading the city, and industry-city integration” (“One Core”: Smart Brain; “One Corridor”: the north-south urban corridor along the business office area; “One Vein”: the Lianxi River water system).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clustered and Concentrated Logistics Industry\n",
      "\n",
      "The Xiangtang Railway Logistics Base has been approved as a national Class I railway logistics hub and Jiangxi’s provincial logistics center, and the commercial vehicle logistics base has surpassed annual transportation of 200,000 vehicles. Over 20 branded logistics enterprises have settled in Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City, with storage space exceeding 500,000 square meters; flagship companies such as JD Logistics, Suning Logistics, Cainiao Network, Transfar Logistics, and China Merchants Logistics have all set up operations here. It has become one of the most concentrated logistics parks in Jiangxi Province. Focusing on optimizing existing premium train services and launching new ones, eight international freight train routes have opened (Nanchang Xiangtang to Rotterdam, Netherlands; Hanoi, Vietnam; Moscow, Russia; Minsk and Orsha, Belarus; Paris, France; Kyiv, Ukraine; and Malaszewicze, Poland), and five rail-sea intermodal trains for foreign trade (Nanchang Xiangtang to Yantian Port Shenzhen, Beilun Port Ningbo, Jiangyin Port Fujian, Gaoqi Port Xiamen, and Shanghai Port). In 2020, 767 foreign trade trains were dispatched, carrying 46,372 TEUs in imports and exports—an increase of 17.28% and 44.17% year-on-year, respectively—providing a low-cost, convenient channel for Jiangxi's quality products to reach overseas markets.\n",

      "Industry-Education Integration Talent Base\n",

Specialized programs include logistics management, e-commerce, fashion design, aircraft manufacturing and maintenance, pharmaceutical logistics, and railway transportation management. The region actively explores and perfects innovative talent training models that integrate academia and industry, continually supplying thousands of professionals to the New City. Long-term, “order-based” education and employment partnerships have been established with investment-attracted companies in the New City, including co-building student internship bases, student entrepreneurship incubators, and modern logistics industry-education-research training bases. Through triangulated cooperation between government, schools, and enterprises, all parties’ resources and elements are activated, building a strategic think tank for industrial development and achieving a win-win in technology services, result transformation, and talent development.\n",

      "Cost Reduction and Efficiency Enhancement via the “Three Consistencies” Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "Relying on Nanchang's rail-sea intermodal transport, Xiangtang has pioneered the “Three Consistencies” pilot: providing enterprises with subsidies for railway transport costs throughout the journey, subsidies for the collection and distribution costs between origin/destination and stations, and developing a smart border port. Gradually, this achieves “inbound goods at the same port price as coastal ports, outbound shipments at the same starting price as coastal ports, and clearance efficiency equal to that of the coast.” The policy accelerates the agglomeration of import and export goods from surrounding regions to Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City, further reducing logistics costs for outbound-oriented enterprises, promoting open economic development, improving the upstream and downstream logistics industrial chain, and strengthening the port economy zone. At the same time, an annual fund pool of 100 million yuan is set aside for the “Three Consistencies” policy and prepayment of export tax rebates, ensuring sufficient cash flow. Fully leveraging the international freight express channel from Nanchang Xiangtang to coastal ports, Xiangtang is being forged into a “direct express” for access to international markets and an “accelerator” for the development of an open economy, promoting the construction of the Jiangxi Inland Open Economic Pilot Zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nanchang Xiangtang International Inland Port New City is an important platform for Nanchang’s opening up to the outside world. Xiangtang Town will further improve the quality of “bringing in”, refine its “going out” system, focus on building a modern logistics system, foster new economies, new business formats, and new models, adhere to the “four excellence” requirements, benchmark against developed coastal regions, and strengthen the construction, operation, and management of the international inland port. This will effectively showcase Nanchang’s positive image to the world, making it the core zone supporting Jiangxi’s inland open economic pilot zone, a model hub for the integrated development of “Port-Industry-City-People,” and a strategic fulcrum and new highland for Jiangxi Province’s participation in shaping a new development pattern.\n",

All localities and departments must thoroughly examine and analyze issues, draw inferences from one instance to find potential problems, truly take the warning to heart, and stay highly vigilant—making prevention a priority by implementing and refining preventive measures. Focusing on flash flood and geological disaster prevention, the province will resolutely implement special actions for disaster prevention, mitigation, and evacuation. Comprehensive investigations and full screening of safety risks and hidden dangers at all mountain-area sites and camps potentially affected by floods will be carried out, along with a new round of geological disaster inspections. The principle of \"reaching down to the bottom\" must be upheld, ensuring that safety responsibilities for disaster prevention and mitigation are assigned to the smallest unit, every position, and every worker; under no circumstance should situations arise where management is ineffective, absent, unmanageable, or neglected.\n",

Zhang Ke, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Director of the Administration, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, emphasizing the need to thoroughly implement the essence of Xi Jinping’s important speech, implement the reform decisions and deployments from the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, adhere to a people-centered approach, fully implement reform tasks, strengthen reform confidence, ensure correct reform direction, reinforce reform responsibility, pool collective reform strength, and advance healthcare security reform with firm and steady steps, striving to eliminate the worries of the entire population regarding medical treatment for illnesses.\n",

Xi Jinping’s speech is of great significance for our thorough and accurate understanding of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, gaining a deep grasp of the guiding ideology, overall goals, key principles, and scientific methods of further comprehensively deepening reform. It provides important guidance for promoting stable and long-term reform on the new journey and ensuring accurate implementation and effectiveness of various reform measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting stressed that the National Healthcare Security Administration must deeply understand and grasp the rich connotations, core essentials, and practical requirements of the spirit of Xi Jinping’s important speech. We must have a deep understanding of the key principles of reform. Xi Jinping’s speech highlighted that innovation within a framework of adherence to established truths is a fundamental principle that must be firmly held throughout the reform process. The National Healthcare Security Administration must uphold the Party’s overall leadership, adhere to Marxism, uphold socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the people’s democratic dictatorship, and take promoting social fairness and justice, and enhancing people's well-being as the starting point and objective. Reform must have direction and principle: what must be reformed should be reformed resolutely, and what should not be reformed must not be changed. We must deeply understand and grasp scientific methods of reform. Xi Jinping’s speech made it clear that reform is a systemic project requiring scientific methods to properly handle various relationships. The Administration must guide and advance reform through scientific approaches, master and apply the scientific methodology of reform, combine focused priorities and comprehensive advancement, unify reform with the rule of law, uphold the dialectical unity of removal and establishment, unite reform and opening up, and properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation, ensuring consistent and thorough reform implementation.\n",

Measures include protecting the “young”—providing policy preference for pediatrics and children’s medications, accelerating the connection and implementation of newborn care, labor analgesia, and other pricing items, promoting the upgrading and optimization of pediatric and obstetric services, studying and improving the maternity insurance system, and further strengthening the support function for childbirth; caring for the “elderly”—actively promoting the establishment of a long-term care insurance system, optimizing services exempt from the need for companions, and preparing for the challenges of an aging society; guaranteeing care for the “ill”—expanding the scope of family mutual aid in workers’ medical insurance personal accounts, steadily enlarging cross-provincial direct settlement for outpatient chronic and special diseases, and providing more convenient services for patients with chronic and special diseases; supporting the “new”—enabling more new and quality drugs to be included in the medical insurance catalogue; fighting against the “false”—fully covering the battle against health insurance fraud to protect the people's medical funds and lifesaving money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting emphasized the need to foster a positive reform atmosphere, both in terms of public opinion and in managing reform expectations, to broadly build consensus on reform, mobilize all positive factors, promote the main theme, transmit positive energy, and create a strong atmosphere throughout the system that supports, participates in, and advances reform. It called for even closer unity around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, resolutely upholding the “two establishes” and ensuring the “two upholds,” unifying thought and action with the spirit of Xi Jinping’s important speech and the plenary session’s deployments, maintaining unity and determination, forging ahead with perseverance, and contributing the strength of healthcare security to further deepening reform and promoting Chinese modernization.\n",

      "Chelegle is a pioneering herder entrepreneur from Zhalute Banner. In recent years, she has dedicated herself to public welfare. Upon learning about the \"Party Member Mothers\" volunteer service initiative launched by the Women's Federation, she immediately signed up.

      "As the initiating organization of the \"Party Member Mothers\" volunteer initiative, all 13 female Party members of the Tongliao Women’s Federation have joined the program, taking the lead in visiting needy children in locations such as Kulun Banner and the development zone. They paired up with the children, exchanged \"Love Contact Cards,\" and developed deep bonds. Among these experiences, what impressed Women's Federation Chairwoman Bao Hongmei the most was the \"Colorful Holiday Public Welfare Summer Supervision Class\" held in the Shentiehepan Garden Community. It offered 25 children vibrant activities and personalized tutoring, making their holidays enjoyable and unforgettable. In her view, imparting wisdom and supporting growth are the longest-lasting confessions of love to children.\n",

The policewomen from Tongliao Public Security Bureau enter Hongxing Central Primary School, using pictures, quizzes, and interactive Q&As to explain anti-drug knowledge, thus enhancing the children’s ability to resist and avoid drugs.\n",

      "The Tongliao Women’s Federation has integrated the \"Civilized Family,\" \"Five-Good Family,\" and \"Most Beautiful Family\" selection programs into the \"Party Member Mothers\" volunteer initiative, widely promoting touching stories throughout society.

      "The initiative also fully utilizes Tongliao’s red (revolutionary) cultural resources, incorporating Party history education through visits to revolutionary sites, storytelling, singing red songs, and watching red movies—offering children patriotism and revolutionary tradition education.

      "The first episode is “[What Makes China China](何以中国).”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over five thousand years, where does the name \"China\" originate? Among an ocean of ancient texts and relics, can we find the earliest reference to \"China\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s first domestic inspection visit was to the Yinxu (Yin Ruins) site in Anyang. He emphasized the need to continue to value and strengthen archaeological work and to further deepen the project tracing the origins of Chinese civilization. Archaeology not only answers the profound question of \"Where do we come from and where are we going?\" but also provides a contemporary answer to \"What makes China China.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the borders of ancient relics, one can catch a glimpse of millennia.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Yinxu site, where “a single oracle bone awed the world,” to the Liangzhu site, which provides “5,000 years of tangible evidence of Chinese civilization,” and to the “Pearl of the Silk Road,” the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang—\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party, during inspection visits and research across the country, General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly visited museums, memorials, and cultural relic protection sites, fueling a rising “archaeology fever” and “museum fever” across China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultural heritage is “breaking the circle” and going viral: what was once niche is becoming mainstream—the “highbrow” is no longer reserved for the few.

      "It now takes just 10 minutes to complete the entire process for renewing a driver's license, and services like newborn household registration can be done at a single window. The process for replacing lost ID cards has been simplified, and temporary IDs can be issued on the spot. Since the beginning of this year, all public security service counters in Lincang city, Yunnan province, have been integrated into the county-level government service centers. The number of public security service counters has been streamlined from 186 business-specific counters to 138 comprehensive service counters, and the number of officers and auxiliary police staff manning these counters has been optimized from 476 to 380. The number of services available at the government service centers has increased from 32 to 133, with a citizen satisfaction rate of over 98%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lincang Public Security Bureau has vigorously promoted the integration of public security administrative services into the three-tiered government service centers, striving to shift from “multiple counters for different police departments” to “integrated services at a single window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lincang, comprehensive public security service counters that combine functions of petition, traffic police, anti-narcotics, public order, cybersecurity, and immigration have been set up in the county (district) government service centers. At the township level, service centers have set up comprehensive counters that integrate petition, traffic police, and public order services for the convenience of the public. In townships where conditions do not yet allow for in-center service, over-the-counter police and traffic police services have been integrated into convenience service stations. Currently, comprehensive public security service counters have been fully set up in the government service centers of all 8 counties (districts), with 32 police stations entering township convenience service centers, and 8 police stations integrating with traffic police business counters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, in line with the principle of “quick general service at comprehensive counters, specialized service at dedicated counters,” a dual-track service model of “generalist + specialist” has been established. No less than 50% of windows at county-level public security service centers are comprehensive—accepting all services at the front desk, with classification and approval at the back office, and disbursing documents at the comprehensive window. “One window can now do the work of three or four separate windows,” as staff put it.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the summer holiday, Lincang’s government service center’s public security comprehensive service counter experienced peak business, averaging 150 to 200 cases processed on the spot daily, peaking at over 300 cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To provide efficient and high-quality service to the public, we have to understand the business of all departments and learn as we go,” said window officer Chen Pin. Since being assigned to the comprehensive service window in December last year, Chen Pin, who previously only handled immigration services, has quickly become an all-around expert at the comprehensive service window.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a focus on public satisfaction, the Lincang Public Security Bureau continues to strengthen responsibility awareness, holds regular training sessions, implements a job rotation system, and ensures robust capacity support. The service window department has also improved and implemented systems such as the “first inquiry responsibility system,” the service commitment system, the time-limited processing system, and the conditional processing system. Business process flowcharts and standardized service guides and procedures have also been compiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 16, eight citizens in Lincang experienced the convenience of “one-stop, one-time processing” when handling newborn household registration as part of the city’s first pilot group. After a baby is born, the hospital uploads the birth information directly to the public security system; parents only need to bring the required documents to handle household registration, and to purchase health and social insurance at the government service center. “The entire process takes less than 20 minutes, and parents can get the household booklet right at the site,” said Yang Sihan, a worker at the Lincang Government Service Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lincang Public Security Bureau has strengthened data sharing and vigorously promoted interdepartmental joint handling of public security services that have strong relevance and high public demand, achieving “immediate processing” for urgent matters and maximizing the benefits of reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Services such as renewing or replacing an expired or lost driver’s license, household registration for homebuyers, and temporary residence registration are among the 50 high-frequency public security services now fully available online as announced to the public by the Lincang Public Security Bureau. This upgraded version of government service forms an integrated “chessboard” work pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, to ensure customer convenience reaches every corner, Lincang Public Security has leveraged the extensive network, long business hours, and urban-rural coverage of “business, insurance, postal, banking, and medical” locations, deepening collaborations in the form of “police-business, police-insurance, police-post, police-bank, and police-medical” partnerships. This has helped smooth the “last mile” for businesses and citizens handling their affairs.\n",

      "Yang Xianyi was a remarkably talented scholar, a figure of rare brilliance even within academic circles. His two younger sisters were also extraordinary. The eldest, Yang Minru, was a specialist in classical Chinese literature, while the second sister, Yang Jingru (later known as Yang Yi), became a renowned translator. They were all born into a cultured, scholarly family. Their father, Yang Yuzhang, had received a traditional Chinese education in his youth before studying economics at Waseda University in Japan. Upon returning to China, he became the first president of the Bank of China in Tianjin, using his abilities to amass a fortune worth millions, with his only regret being his lack of an heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first wife bore eight pregnancies but only two daughters survived. Yang Yuzhang then took a second wife. In 1915, she gave birth to a son, Yang Xianyi. The arrival of a son was a moment of great joy for the family. After his birth, Yang Xianyi was taken to live with the first wife and became the most cherished member of the family. The second wife subsequently bore two daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Xianyi was five, his father suddenly died of an illness at a young age, leaving behind a large inheritance as well as three women and six children (including a concubine and her daughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi’s mother was just 24 at the time. She resolved to raise all three of her children well and provide them with a good education. Coming from a humble background in rural Hebei, she was the daughter of a poor family, with little formal schooling—having been sold as a concubine to the Yang family. She was young, beautiful, and intelligent, quickly winning her husband’s genuine love. She soon learned to read under his tutelage; their bond deepened as they often read novels together, and she discovered joy in reading that she’d never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, these sweet days lasted only six or seven years before her husband’s sudden death left her devastated. Her three children became her greatest solace. Because she bore the family’s only son, Yang Xianyi, she received several tens of thousands of yuan in stocks as her portion of the inheritance, which ensured the family a relatively comfortable life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife, herself from a wealthy, well-matched family, had attended private school and loved to play mahjong above all else. Good-natured, she treated the two concubines and the children fairly well, but she believed in the saying, \"A woman’s virtue lies in her lack of talent,\" and never cared about her own daughters' education. On the other hand, Yang Xianyi’s mother, having personally experienced the benefits of learning, secured schooling opportunities for her daughters. As soon as each reached school age, she placed them in the American mission school—Tianjin Zhongxi Girls’ School, the city’s finest at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the only boy in this affluent household, Yang Xianyi was treated like a \"little emperor\" from birth. He enjoyed a life of luxury and showed himself to be not only bright but also mischievous from a young age. For instance, he once poured a bottle of French brandy—meant for his father—into the fish tank and then watched with amusement as the \"drunken fish\" tumbled about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife fervently wished for this darling boy to grow up smoothly and, perhaps out of superstition, ranked him alongside the girls—believing that a girl's fate was \"cheap,\" and so girls were easy to raise. The first and second daughters were hers, Yang Xianyi was third, the concubine’s daughter was fourth, and Yang Minru and Yang Jingru were fifth and sixth. Because of this, his uncles’ children would joke by calling him \"Miss Yang the Third.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the true \"apple of the family’s eye.\" His sister Yang Minru recalled: \"He had toys that ordinary people never saw. There’s one toy we still played with when we grew up—now called a music box. It played tinkling music inside, with a few men and women dancing, all dressed in the French Louis XIV style. That music box was very precious. And that was just one of his toys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At age seven, worried about possible kidnappings, his first mother invited the former Qing-era scholar Mr. Wei Ruzhou to the house to tutor Yang Xianyi. He began by reading the \"Three Character Classic\" and \"Hundred Family Surnames,\" then worked through the Four Books and Five Classics, \"Gu Wen Guan Zhi,\" and Tang and Song poetry, building a solid foundation in classical Chinese studies. Even though he wasn’t particularly hardworking, he always received praise from Mr. Wei. During this period, he also read many miscellaneous books.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until age thirteen that his first mother allowed Yang Xianyi to attend New Learning Academy, a church school, for middle school.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "At school, Yang Xianyi continued to be lax in his studies, preferring to play. The student who always ranked first in class worked extremely hard, but Yang said, \"I don’t compete with him, so I always come second.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was also fond of pranks. Once, during an algebra exam, a classmate struggled with some questions. Yang Xianyi wrote the answers on a note and passed it over, even sticking one on the teacher’s back. The teacher paced about invigilating, and the answer was in clear view for everyone… When the teacher eventually discovered it and questioned him, Yang confessed frankly. Rather than punishing him, the teacher praised him for his honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Mr. Wei grew elderly and left, Yang Xianyi’s mother hired another tutor to teach English and math to Yang Xianyi and his sisters to improve their already good grades—her ambition was for all her children to excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sisters deeply admired their brother, perceiving themselves as dull by comparison. Yang Minru said, \"He could recite all thirteen classics fluently when I hadn’t even finished learning the Four Books and Five Classics myself. In middle school, he was already plotting to write chapter novels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru added, \"My brother was so smart. He wrote classical poetry at age seven, was quick at matching lines—our tutor’s name was Xu Jiansheng (‘Xu the Swordsman’). My brother took one look and whipped up a reply: ‘Kuai Qiangbi’ (‘Hurry Firing Squad’).\" (A play on matching surnames/characters in Chinese.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The teacher Xu Jiansheng—whose name Yang Xianyi humorously matched as \"Kuai Qiangbi\"—wasn’t angered. Instead, he was delighted to encounter such a talented student. It was this same teacher Xu who gave the siblings a solid grounding in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam Xu, a Guangdong native and graduate of Sun Yat-sen University’s English literature department, was married to Dr. Chi Shiqing. She fit in perfectly with the Yangs. The children called her \"Teacher,\" while their mother called her \"Mrs. Chi.\" Later, their mother even had her children formally recognize Madam Xu as their \"godmother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yang mansion, located on Huayuan Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, was a large residence with a life of comfort and leisure, attended by servants. The Yang siblings went to the movies every week, watching both Chinese and foreign films. Their mother was strict yet gave them ample freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru, a premature baby, had always been frail. On doctors’ advice, her mother often took the children into nature for fresh air. In the summer of 1931, she took her three children and invited Madam Xu on a holiday to Beijing’s Fragrant Hills—their first trip outside Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidentally, Yang Xianyi’s cousin Yang Zuanwu and his Nankai School classmate Luo Peilin were also vacationing there. Luo came from a wealthy family and was a top student. That year, after finishing high school and awaiting university entrance results, the young people played together—running and singing on the mountains, playing chess and cards in the villa… Luo got on well with Yang Minru, and they left a good impression on each other. It was a very happy holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, a few years later Yang Xianyi’s uncles spent the family inheritance, forcing the Yangs to sell the Huayuan Street house. The eldest sister married, the second passed away, the concubine left with her daughter, and the extended family scattered. The first wife, mother, and Yang Xianyi and his sisters moved to a rented house on Zhaofeng Road, in the French concession. The once prosperous family gradually dwindled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1934, after graduating from middle school, Yang Xianyi enrolled in Yenching University—and did so well academically that the school let him skip directly to sophomore year. At that time, his British high school teacher was about to go home for a sabbatical, and Yang wanted to follow him to study at Oxford. Though his first mother hoped to keep him at home as heir, he was determined to go, and his own mother strongly supported further study abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Yang Minru was accepted into Yenching’s Chinese department, studying under Gu Sui. In 1937, Yang Jingru graduated middle school and was recommended directly to Nankai University’s Chinese department. The \"July 7th Incident\" broke out—the start of full-scale war with Japan—and Nankai University was bombed. As a \"re-established student,\" she went to continue her studies at Southwest Associated University in Kunming.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Yang Minru was at Yenching, she received a letter from Luo Peilin, then a graduate of Shanghai Jiaotong University, professing his feelings for her. She told her mother, who found out that Luo’s parents had already arranged a marriage for him, and firmly forbade her daughter from seeing him. After finishing her degree, Yang Minru stayed on as a graduate student with Professor Gu for a year and a half. In the winter of 1939, she took her mother to Chongqing, the wartime capital, together with staff from the Tianjin Bank of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, hundreds of employees relocated to Chongqing to establish a new branch. The bank’s manager, Mr. Pan—who had started as a clerk under Yang Yuzhang—took good care of the mother and daughter. But proud as always, her mother paid her own way and refused any handouts or privileges. Finding a job at the bank would have been easy for Yang Minru, but she wanted independence, not patronage. And so, she and her mother declined employment at the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chongqing, Yang Minru looked for work to support herself and her mother. With her background as a Yenching University Chinese graduate student, she quickly became a teacher at Chongqing Nankai Middle School, able to teach both Chinese and English. Under principal Zhang Boling, the school was uniquely rigorous yet lively, and teachers’ salaries were above average; mother and daughter were content.\n",
      "\n",
      "By then, Luo Peilin had broken off his arranged marriage and arrived in Chongqing as well. With her mother’s permission, Yang Minru started corresponding with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru entered Southwest Associated University in Kunming and, on Professor Shen Congwen’s advice, transferred to the foreign languages department. Soon, a senior named Zhao Ruihong started courting her earnestly, and the two married in haste. In her sophomore year, she found herself about to become a mother and, overwhelmed, suspended her studies. Her mother, angered when she learned of this in Chongqing, scolded her severely but agreed to take care of the child on the condition Yang Jingru finish her degree. Thus, after just one year off, Yang Jingru transferred to study English at National Central University (now Nanjing University) for two years, obtaining a degree issued by Southwest Associated University.

      "[In-depth Study and Implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era]\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the “Thirty Talks on Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” compiled under the organization of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, was publicly published and distributed. The book is divided into 30 topics, providing a comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth explanation of the significance, scientific system, rich connotations, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It serves as an important supplementary reading for cadres and the masses to deeply study and understand Xi Jinping’s new era thought. This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up; as I read the book’s chapters on comprehensive opening up, I cannot help but feel a particular pride in our Party’s vision and magnanimity in advancing a new pattern of comprehensive opening up, and a heartfelt pride in the theoretical innovation, depth of vision, and breadth of perspective our Party has achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1978, China has become increasingly open. Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, we opened our doors for construction and successfully achieved the great transformation from closed and semi-closed conditions to all-round opening up. Facing the new journey ahead, we must promote high-quality development of the Chinese economy in a more open environment to continuously meet people’s needs for a better life. Currently, the international landscape is undergoing profound changes; the world economy and global economic governance system have entered a period of adjustment. The undercurrents of protectionism in Western developed countries are surging, and the previously aggressive expansion of the West has turned increasingly inward; at the same time, emerging markets and developing countries are collectively rising, and there is a “rise of the East and South, decline of the West and North” in the international balance of power. At this time of global uncertainty, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward the important strategic idea of forming a new comprehensive opening-up pattern. Xi Jinping’s thinking is based on the strategic height of both human social development and national rejuvenation, responding to the demands of the times for a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. Seizing the opportunity to expand openness is not only a valuable experience in China’s reform and development, but also the only path to national prosperity. For contemporary China, openness is by no means a matter of expedient strategy, but an inevitable strategic choice for seeking high-quality development. In fact, forming a higher-level pattern of opening up has already become a key decision for the fate of contemporary China and the achievement of the dream of national rejuvenation. Comprehensive opening up is not optional, but rather a key instrument for our Party to lead the Chinese people in catching up with the times in international competition and realizing the great renewal of the Chinese nation. Looking around the world, comprehensive opening up has become the driving and fundamental mark of China’s rapid and thriving development, and the most inspiring and attractive emblem of the Communist Party of China's leadership in the new era of international relations. High-level comprehensive opening up is a defining feature of today’s China, and a distinctive mark of the Party's governance in the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is a necessary driving force for accelerating the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Openness brings progress, while closure inevitably leads to backwardness. Human development rests on advances in productive forces, which depend on technological invention and improvement, and these in turn rely on the innovation and accumulation of human knowledge and experience. Diverse environments stimulate creativity of thought, and exchanges between different civilizations are conducive to the innovation and spread of knowledge. Only through ever-expanding exchanges can human wisdom be inspired and knowledge and technology disseminated more broadly. The Chinese nation has had a glorious past—an era of grand vision and broad-minded exchange with surrounding peoples; we have also experienced periods of decline, resulting from self-isolation and closed doors. Opening up to the outside world is China’s fundamental national policy and a vital instrument for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuous achievements in socialist modernization. We should expand the scope and depth of our opening up, engaging in ever-wider cultural exchange, learning, and mutual reference, broadening our vision of experience and thought through communication, accelerating the transfer of knowledge and skills through learning, and inspiring new knowledge and technology through mutual learning. Ancient Chinese inventions once benefited the world, just as many technologies from modern developed countries have promoted China’s development. On the road of great rejuvenation, the Chinese nation should embrace ever greater broad-mindedness in order to spark creative vitality and enhance our competitiveness through the interplay of diverse cultures and civilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is the necessary prerequisite for expanding the world stage for national rejuvenation. Only in the vast ocean can a dragon grow and thrive; in a small stream, muddy swamp, or shallow pond, only small fish and shrimp can survive—never a giant whale. Marxism teaches us that practice brings true knowledge and real results, but the size of the stage for practice often determines the breadth of experience; the size of the stage for our undertakings often determines their significance. The times produce heroes; heroes need a grander stage. Struggle promotes national rejuvenation; those who struggle need larger space. By expanding openness, we are creating a broader space and stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Human history is developed through openness, and civilization is spread and enriched through openness. China is an ancient civilization, but due to rulers’ closed-door policy, it declined in modern times, while the discovery of the New World turned an isolated world into a closely linked one, providing a stage for the West’s rise. Today, our opening up is no longer a matter of ancient Han and Tang strategies toward neighbors but participation in the tides of economic globalization—truly stepping onto the world stage and providing a broader platform for national rejuvenation. Only by forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening up can we better coordinate both international and domestic markets, resources, and rules. Comprehensive opening up involves not just commodities, but also human resources; we should seek intelligent minds globally, coordinate both domestic and international talent, stimulate greater waves of wisdom, and power our innovation-driven strategy. Today, realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation means once again returning to the center of the world stage—a stage broader than the “All Under Heaven” perspective of antiquity, but a truly global stage. Only by shouldering greater responsibility and playing a larger role on this global stage can we truly achieve national rejuvenation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is the inevitable choice to guide the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through national rejuvenation. China’s reform, opening up, and peaceful development constitute a globally significant event at the turn of the 21st century—after all, China accounts for one-fifth of the world's population. China’s development has enabled the nation to escape its modern-era poverty and backwardness and, with its vast market potential, has provided development opportunities for the whole world. On this planet, economic globalization has created a complex and ever-tighter linkage that forms a situation in which “you are part of me, and I am part of you”—a pattern of shared prosperity or loss. Yet, some people, when it suits them, make loud proclamations about “free trade”; but when things are unfavorable, they build walls of protectionism. Facing such a situation, China confidently insists on expanding openness and strives to form a new, comprehensive opening-up pattern. Driving the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and achieving shared prosperity requires expanding both the breadth and depth of openness. Our Belt and Road Initiative is precisely about building a new platform for international cooperation and connectivity, adding new impetus to common development, and advancing the building of a community of shared destiny for humanity. The Belt and Road Initiative comes from China but belongs to the world. It is an open platform and should cross the boundaries of different regions, civilizations, and stages of development. The Belt and Road is a road of win-win cooperation and should continually extend and develop. As long as everyone is clear about the goal of connectivity and win-win cooperation, strengthens policy coordination, aligns development strategies, and upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits; strengthens policy communication, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds; and relies on project-driven, pragmatic cooperation, we are sure to promote the development and prosperity of all countries and benefit all peoples.\n",

      "Comprehensive opening up is the only road to demonstrate the vitality of socialism through national rejuvenation. Socialism became a reality in the tide of the international communist movement, and can only grow stronger in the surging tide of global currents. Our practice of reform and opening up has blazed the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and ushered in a bright future for national rejuvenation; only further, comprehensive opening up can inject strong momentum into achieving national rejuvenation and bring great vigor to scientific socialism in China. China’s door to openness is getting wider, not only promoting the continuous development and improvement of our path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, raising the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics high in the world, and demonstrating the practical path for developing countries to achieve modernization under Marxism’s guidance, but also providing new options for those countries and nations wishing to speed up development while maintaining their independence, and contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to humanity’s problems.\n",

      "Huili City in Liangshan Prefecture is renowned as \"China's Hometown of Pomegranates,\" boasting the largest pomegranate planting area and yield among the eight major pomegranate-producing regions in China. At present, it is the season for pomegranate harvesting and sales, attracting buyers from across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following a convoy of large trucks from all over China, the reporter arrived at Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Co., Ltd. in Baicao Village, Luchang Town, Huili City. Along the sorting line, plump and rosy pomegranates were selected, weighed, and loaded onto trucks before being shipped to destinations such as Southeast Asia, beginning their international journey. \"Currently, our annual exports are around 10,000 tons, with a revenue of roughly 50 million yuan,\" said Zuo Ziwen, chairman of Wanqing Pomegranate Professional Cooperative of Huili City.\n",

      "\n",
      "Zuo Ziwen, a native of Huili, has been cultivating pomegranates for more than 30 years. Picking up a soft-seed pomegranate, he proudly peeled it open in front of the reporter and said, \"Look how excellent our Huili pomegranates are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even high-quality products face sales difficulties. “In the past, our good produce couldn’t fetch good prices. When the market was bad, an entire year’s work amounted to nothing,” said Zuo Ziwen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying reason is that the pomegranate harvest season is concentrated. When supply piles up and shelf life can’t be extended, growers have no choice but to sell at low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years ago, in order to keep pomegranates fresh and prolong their storage life, Zuo, after much research, started building cold storage facilities with controlled-atmosphere (CA) technology. Today, a modern pomegranate trading center and auction market integrating grading, online transactions, information release, storage and processing, cold-chain logistics, financial services, and big data analysis has been established in Baicao Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This agricultural product sorting facility covers 40,000 square meters, with 37 CA cold storage units for keeping over 6,500 tons of produce,\" said Zuo Ziwen. The CA storage helps regulate supply between peak and off-peak periods, taking advantage of market timing. Pomegranates stored in these facilities retain their brightness and freshness, enhancing their market value and strengthening the industry’s competitive edge.\n",

      "Solving storage and preservation problems means Huili pomegranates can reach farther markets. However, issues such as inefficient operations and weak channels still hamper agricultural products going the distance. For further development, the entire “production-supply-marketing” chain needs to be connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Center in Baicao Village, even larger areas are devoted to physical sorting, packaging, and e-commerce operations. Over 100 dealers from across the country have settled here, and the logistics center’s cold storage, turnover baskets, steel shelves, sorting equipment, and forklifts are all available for use by e-commerce businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On one hand, the cooperation between companies, co-ops, and farmers provides technical guidance to ensure high-quality products enter the market. On the other hand, by collecting customer information, we can develop precise sales strategies, establish fruit grading standards, and diversify sales channels,” Zuo explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supporting construction of socialized service systems, e-commerce service centers, the Huili Pomegranate Auction Center, and supply chains have also helped build the Huili pomegranate brand, enabling local agricultural products to be marketed nationwide and even overseas—both online and offline—thus boosting farmers’ incomes and prosperity.\n",
      "\n",

      "For a long time, Sinopec’s Petroleum Geophysical Prospecting Technology Research Institute has focused on the exploration and development challenges of the Tarim Basin, independently developing and tackling key technologies for ultra-deep oil and gas reservoir geophysical exploration. Emphasizing the process-driven, standardized, and regulated methodology sequence of technological approaches, the institute has provided robust support for the efficient exploration and development of the Northwest Oilfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on Fundamental Research to Solidify the Foundation for Technological Innovation\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are closely associated with strike-slip fault geological activity, resulting in distinctive fault-controlled reservoirs. Researchers have developed the “trace the vine to find the melon” technical route—first identify strike-slip faults, then explore oil and gas reservoirs. However, due to the great burial depth of the reservoir targets, man-made seismic reflection signals returning to the surface are weak and additionally affected by near-surface desert conditions and deep high-velocity igneous rock shielding effects, making signal “decoding” even more challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle this, researchers established a series of three-dimensional seismic-geological models of strike-slip fault systems and ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs in the Tarim Basin. Using 3D numerical and physical simulation methods, they studied the seismic wave propagation mechanisms through ultra-deep complex fault-controlled reservoirs, summarizing the propagation laws and seismic response characteristics of fault-controlled reservoirs with different structural styles. These foundational research outcomes provide analytical bases for subsequent seismic deployment and interpretation, and offer theoretical support for optimizing seismic data acquisition parameters and improving imaging accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the institute has advanced fundamental rock physics research in the ultra-deep sector, building high-level experimental platforms and key technologies. In response to the ultra-high temperature and pressure underground environments of ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs, they established the industry’s first comprehensive high-temperature/high-pressure rock physics testing platform for depths up to 10,000 meters, extending capacity from 5,000 meters to over 12,000 meters. This advancement pushes the frontiers of domestic and international experimental equipment and technology for deep and ultra-deep oil and gas studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through ultra-high temperature and pressure testing, researchers clarified the temperature and pressure dependency of high-temperature/high-pressure ultrasonic sensors, developed sensor temperature-pressure correction technology, and revealed the rock physics properties of key diagenetic minerals in carbonate rocks under such conditions. They built rock physics models and interpretation templates applicable for deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs, achieving practical applications in ultra-deep geological target evaluation and “sweet spot” engineering prediction. These efforts yielded several original theoretical results supporting the integrated geophysical engineering of “deep earth projects.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Seismic processing and imaging techniques are akin to giving the Earth a CT scan and serve as vital means for opening up high-definition underground views. Addressing challenges such as weak seismic reflection energy and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in ultra-deep layers, the institute developed the “two wides, one long, one small” (wide azimuth, wide bandwidth, long spread, small bin size) seismic acquisition technology. This approach effectively reduces the signal shielding effects of shallow anomalous velocity bodies, increases effective seismic reflection information in ultra-deep layers, and produces high-quality data with richer azimuthal reflection information, significantly enhancing the identification capacity for complex structures, geological anomaly bodies, faults, lithology, and petrophysical properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harsh desert surface conditions and complex underground structures lead to the development of various strong interference waves, significant near-surface absorption and attenuation, and serious signal shielding/interference from special rock bodies. To address these issues, researchers innovatively developed the “three protections, one test” (protect diffraction, protect amplitude, protect low-frequency weak signals, parameter testing to pre-stack time migration imaging) processing technology suite. This includes desert surface-based ultra-deep weak signal protection/preserving denoising, near-surface Q compensation, amplitude and wavelet consistency processing, and layer-controlled, data-driven interlayer multiple suppression. These advances enhance effective seismic signal energy and SNR, broaden the effective bandwidth, and provide high-fidelity data for subsequent seismic imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "For fine imaging of ultra-deep target oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, researchers innovatively developed a series of full-azimuth angle-domain imaging and broadband, high-end reverse time migration (RTM) imaging technologies. Full-azimuth angle-domain imaging fully utilizes wide azimuth seismic data to image target domains from multiple underground angles, depicting the profiles and internal structures of fault-controlled reservoirs and dissolution vugs/fractures multi-dimensionally. Building on the analytic wave field RTM theory, they developed anisotropic RTM technology, effectively mitigating the effects of fracture heterogeneity. The development of broadband Q-compensation RTM effectively compensates for signal attenuation during ultra-long-range propagation. High-resolution least-squares RTM technology now enables underground illumination compensation, increasing imaging accuracy for steeply dipping structures and small-scale ultra-deep anomalies.\n",

They innovatively developed a deep adaptive convolutional neural network wave impedance inversion method based on deep learning. This resolved previous application difficulties, combined model-driven and data-driven approaches to increase interpretability, and significantly improved performance in describing small-scale vug-fracture clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the challenge of predictive grading for ultra-deep strike-slip faults, a machine-learning-based fracture grading prediction technology was developed and tested with excellent results. This technology establishes a relationship between seismic attributes and drilling blowout/loss, improving detection efficiency and precision and advancing fine prediction technologies for strike-slip fault zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve the quantitative characterization difficulty of ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs, a frequency-variation-attribute-based quantitative description technology was developed. It mines differential features of reservoirs in the frequency domain, achieving breakthroughs in multi-scale vug-fracture cluster prediction/correction and fault scale quantification. It also introduced—for the first time—the concept of Fracture Scale Indicator (FSI), and established a complete workflow from fundamental theory, algorithm design, forward modeling, field data application, to effect evaluation, ultimately leading to a reservoir connectivity evaluation and analysis solution.\n",

      "Addressing the strong reflection shielding effect of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation’s top surface on underlying fault-controlled reservoirs, researchers innovatively optimized matching pursuit strong reflection separation technology, significantly reducing interference from strong reflections in the quantitative description of deep fault-controlled reservoirs. This technology has now been integrated into the latest version of the NEWS software and has become a key step in the quantitative description of almost all fault-controlled reservoirs in the Shunbei area, effectively increasing exploration success rates and economic benefits.\n",

      "To ensure the orderly operation of the night market, Nan’an police have introduced the “321” duty model: joint patrols and coordination among police officers, armed police, and property management; mandatory patrols along two main marketplaces; and deployment at fixed check points for armed rapid response within “1, 3, 5” minutes. This creates an all-round, multi-layered prevention and control system. On weekends and holidays, police from the Nanbin Road Police Station, along with armed police and property staff, carry out fixed-point security, dynamic patrols, and crime prevention publicity—ensuring that “as long as the night market is open, police are on patrol.”\n",

      "At Nanbin Road, every night around 8 pm, anti-fraud awareness videos are repeatedly played on the big screen at the Rainbow Market Concert. The Nanbin Road Police Station also sets up a dedicated stall at the market to display and distribute anti-fraud publicity materials for free. At the same time, police actively work with businesses, by organizing special lectures on telecom network fraud prevention and placing anti-fraud info cards in hotel rooms, to strengthen overall security awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the start of night market concerts, noise disturbance has become the most prominent source of conflict and complaints. The Nan’an police have established a tripartite communication platform among management, vendors, and residents, agreeing on performance schedules and resolving disputes at the source.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Nan’an police make use of the weekly Monday afternoon market break to convene police-community meetings with the vendors, briefing them on security trends and prevention measures in the area, asking about their needs, while also providing targeted guidance on stage setup, security staffing, fire and electrical safety, and the improvement of firefighting facilities, so as to promptly identify and eliminate potential safety hazards. Since May, police have carried out two focused operations and organized two drills on fire safety and counter-terrorism.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a pilot demonstration area for socialism with Chinese characteristics, how to optimize the rule-of-law business environment to achieve high-quality economic and social development is a crucial question for Shenzhen. This year, the Municipal CPPCC included “further optimizing the rule-of-law business environment to ensure high-quality development” in its annual consultation plan. Since April, under the leadership of the Social, Legal, Ethnic, and Religious Affairs Committee, and in conjunction with themed education activities involving extensive visits, discussions, and in-depth investigations, more than 170 members of municipal and district-level CPPCC committees and experts have conducted over 30 research visits.

This level of value for money is simply breaking all the rules—there’s no way for others to compete. The products they make themselves have a cost advantage, and even the things they source are bought at the lowest possible prices. The parts that Bosch Germany supplies to BYD are all sold at the lowest prices—as a top-tier customer. Other domestic companies don’t get this kind of treatment.\n",

Technology can be traded for capital, and it can even be traded for other technology. If you don’t have the technology, others set the prices for you. If you have it, and everyone needs it, then you can negotiate. For example, BYD uses its own ESP system as leverage in price negotiations with Bosch: “If you don’t give me the most favorable price, I’ll just make it myself. Once our production scales up, we might even sell to other automakers.” This is the kind of swagger that tech-enabled companies should have—it’s like King Qin sweeping through the Six Kingdoms.

      "In recent years, Tianmen City has vigorously developed the vegetable industry, with the city’s total vegetable planting area reaching 420,000 mu (about 28,000 hectares) and an annual output of 1.2 million tons. Market-oriented and focused on addressing industrial weaknesses, Tianmen takes multiple measures to build a full-chain vegetable industry, leading industrial upgrading and increasing farmers' incomes. With the development strategy of “buying nationwide, selling nationwide,” and emphasizing its dual core functions of aggregation and distribution, Tianmen is accelerating its efforts to build a vegetable trading and distribution center in Central China.\n",

      "Rows of robust radish seedlings fill the fields with vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duobao Town has the largest vegetable cultivation area in Tianmen, with white radish alone covering 100,000 mu (about 6,700 hectares), generating an output value of over 400 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the town's total agricultural output.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did this little \"radish town\" transform from being unable to sell beyond Hubei as a small-scale seller to now distributing its produce nationwide? On September 13, reporters from Hubei Daily visited Duobao Town for an on-site investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Scattered to Clustered: The Initial Growth of \"Radish Town\"**  \n",
      "Watering, thinning seedlings, fertilizing, weeding... During the autumn planting season, at the vegetable planting base of Hubei Minghe Agricultural Science and Technology Co., Ltd. in Dazhong New Village, Duobao Town, more than one hundred workers are busy in the fields each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "This company is a leading enterprise in Tianmen's vegetable industry, with more than 8,000 mu (about 530 hectares) of self-cultivated land and over 20,000 mu (about 1,335 hectares) contracted out for order-based planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, this kind of scale was unimaginable,” said company chairman Wu Hanping, who began vegetable planting in 2012. At that time, everything was done manually with low mechanization; 300 mu (20 hectares) was already the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back then, Duobao Town mostly grew cotton, wheat, soybeans, etc. Vegetables were grown only in scattered patches by households, resulting in low productivity, unattractive appearance, and a closed market. Wu Hanping and other large-scale growers often visited Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, and other places to learn, bringing back advanced vegetable-growing concepts and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, we had to buy seedlings from outside at as much as 1 to 1.5 yuan per plant — the cost was very high,” Wu Hanping said. In 2017, the company decided to build its own seedling greenhouses. While sunlight greenhouses were popular at the time, he insisted on building multi-span (connected) greenhouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunlight greenhouses could only be used in autumn and winter, whereas multi-span greenhouses allow temperature and humidity to be adjusted freely, enabling year-round seedling cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Minghe’s multi-span greenhouse, the reporters saw all sorts of modernized facilities, including wet curtain cooling, automatic sprinkler irrigation, integrated water and fertilizer systems, and supplemental lighting—showcasing a distinctly technological model.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, with the rise of facility agriculture and progress in agricultural mechanization, Duobao’s vegetable industry has developed rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, sowing radish seeds was done by hand — one person could only plant 1 mu per day. Later, sowing machines became commonplace, and one machine could do 100 mu per day. Now, apart from weeding and harvesting, almost the entire process is mechanized, and in a normal year, average yields exceed 8,000 jin per mu (about 12 tons per hectare).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganlu Village is a well-known “vegetable village.” According to village party secretary Wen Yuanjun, the village has more than 3,000 mu of vegetable plots, radiating out to over 10,000 mu in the surrounding area. For large-scale farmers, it is common to earn over one million yuan per year, while ordinary villagers can make over 100,000 yuan a year through land transfer fees and working at cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Duobao Town maintains about 120,000 mu of vegetable-growing area, with more than 30 varieties including chili peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. About 26,000 households engage in vegetable farming, each increasing their income on average by 12,000 yuan per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Single to Diverse: Even Radishes Are Graded**  \n",
      "No matter how good the quality is, if sales channels are not open, farm products can rot in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days, due to poor logistics and information flow, Duobao radish sales were limited to the areas around Tianmen. “For more distant wholesale markets, you’d call and they’d quote more than 1 yuan per jin, but by the time you got there, the price had dropped to just a few mao (fractions of a yuan),” Wu Hanping recalled. Originally, staff had to be dispatched to check prices at major markets; now, it’s possible to check market prices nationwide online — information and logistics bottlenecks have been solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, with open access to information and logistics turning the entire country into a single market, competition is fiercer than ever. For radishes to go farther and sell better, stable quality is the top priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "By advancing the “three reductions and three increases” (reduced fertilizer, pesticides, and labor; increased yield, income, and efficiency), Minghe Company has cut fertilizer and pesticide use by 5% each, reduced labor per mu by over 13%, and increased yield per mu by over 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "An innovation in sales philosophy is also crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Duobao radishes were sold with dirt still on them, straight from the field to the truck, without grading or packaging. Buyers had to pay for personnel, logistics, and time to sort and grade them, leading to much higher costs compared to mature suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As consumer markets become more segmented, agricultural products must be strictly graded and priced to sell well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, after harvest, Duobao radishes are graded as premium, standard, small, and substandard based on size, weight, and appearance. The price difference between premium and standard radishes is over 0.3 yuan per jin. “The premium radishes, after sorting, are both good-looking and valuable, and can even be packaged as vegetable gift boxes and sold by the piece,” Wu Hanping said. Today, Duobao vegetables are directly supplied to national food supply chain platforms such as Wangjia Huan, Qian Dama, and Duoduo Maicai, delivering directly to thousands of households across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, Minghe Company’s vegetable sales reached 80 million yuan, with continued growth expected this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Learning to Exporting: Duobao Farmers \"Go on Business Trips\" Out of Province**  \n",
      "On September 15, a truck loaded with white radishes arrived at Minghe Company. Workers were already prepared, efficiently washing, sorting, and packaging the radishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the local radishes had just been sown — why was radish-washing work already underway?\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are from our fields in Shaanxi,” Wu Hanping revealed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their selfless aid led to connections. Last year, Wu Hanping was invited to investigate agricultural development in Shaanxi several times. After multiple visits and tests, they now lease 400 mu for vegetable cultivation in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of regional differences, vegetable sowing in Shaanxi is possible in June and July, with the harvest period staggered from Tianmen’s. “With our accumulated experience in cultivation and finance, we can now try to expand outside—this extends the production chain and supports differentiated competition,” Wu explained. The next step is to further expand vegetable planting in other northern provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Hanping’s efforts to plant vegetables in other provinces are not unique. In Ganlu Village, five cooperatives now grow vegetables on more than 3,000 mu in Shandong, Hebei, and Shaanxi.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Wen Yuanzu, head of Shunfa Vegetable Cooperative, Duobao and adjacent regions have already reached a certain scale of contiguous cultivation, and local land rental prices exceed 1,000 yuan per mu. In Shaanxi, however, there is more contiguous land available and rent is relatively low, so the cost advantage is more obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, we went out to study and catch up with advanced regions’ cultivation techniques,” Wu Hanping said. “Now, as we expand to other provinces, we are actually exporting technology, enhancing the Duobao Radish brand, and continuing to grow and strengthen the Duobao radish industry.”\n",

According to the secretary-general of the Chinese delegation, Chinese athletes won gold medals in 14 different sports in Tokyo, marking the highest number of gold-medal sports for China at an overseas Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six major traditional strength events performed steadily. The shooting team set a new Olympic record with 4 gold, 1 silver, and 6 bronze medals. The gymnastics team claimed 3 golds, 3 silvers, and 2 bronzes—remarkable comebacks for both teams after underperforming at the 2016 Rio Games. The weightlifting team, with 7 golds and 1 silver, and the diving team, with 7 golds and 5 silvers, both set their best-ever records. The table tennis team continued its legacy with 4 golds and 3 silvers. The badminton team reached the finals in all five events, ultimately winning 2 golds and 4 silvers.\n",

      "The Olympic journeys of these veterans may end differently, but through unwavering effort, their strength inspires the next generation. The younger athletes have taken up the baton: Quan Hongchan's three perfect dives, Li Wenwen's easy dominance in weightlifting, and Zhang Changhong's pinpoint shooting accuracy. These post-2000-born athletes dare to perform at critical moments, displaying exceptional competitive skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera has captured a series of unforgettable moments: In the women's 4×200m freestyle relay final, young Chinese swimmers lost and regained the lead twice; Chen Lijun gave his all to pull ahead despite an 11-kg deficit; the Chinese women's rugby sevens team reached the quarterfinals in their Olympic debut, showing fearless determination.

The builders at Shaling, with their wisdom and sweat, have achieved fruitful results, continuing to write the legendary story of deep shaft construction for the China National Gold Group, and welcoming the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China with outstanding achievements.\n",

      "Looking back at the construction history of the Shaling project's main shaft, as a demonstration project supporting the national “13th Five-Year Plan” key R&D program “Deep Earth Resource Exploration and Mining,” the main shaft had to cross the Jiaojia main fault, facing complex geological conditions. Issues such as high temperatures, hoisting height, ground stress, high permeability and large water inflow, and strong corrosion arose one after another, covering nearly all the challenges encountered in ultra-deep shaft construction in China. The difficulty of this construction was immense.\n",

      "In the face of these rarely encountered adverse conditions in the country, all participating employees fully embodied the work style of “taking immediate action and striving for practical results.” Since the start of construction in May 2019, they did not wait or rely on others but forged ahead bravely, establishing a “Joint Party Task Group” to tackle major construction difficulties. Through collective wisdom and concerted efforts, they successively overcame eight key challenges including shaft construction efficiency, blasting optimization, grouting for water control, equipment operation, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts from top domestic research institutes were invited on-site to diagnose issues and continuously discuss solutions. They developed a series of deep-level operational specifications, exemplified by behind-the-wall grouting under complex deep geological conditions, which successfully filled many technical gaps in China’s ultra-deep shaft construction field. Continuous consolidation of the “three basics” construction, giving full play to the safety management advantage that “everyone is a safety officer,” and firmly upholding responsibility for safety production have all helped establish a strong foundation for high-quality project development.\n",

At the venue, young artists, inspired by their days stationed in the countryside, immersed themselves in instrumental performances and physical theatre, while citizens were excited to engage in hands-on natural activities such as peeling gorgon fruit, pickling vegetables, and playing bamboo musical instruments. Through these unique forms, everyone experienced the connections between humans and nature, as well as between art and the land.\n",

In 2014, Helin Society launched the first Natural Arts Festival, bringing together experts from art, sociology, design, and planning for forums on how to improve the relationship between humans and nature, and how to integrate art with rural culture. This year, launching the second iteration of the festival, Helin Society took another big step—not only expanding participation nationwide but also implementing an artists-in-residence program in rural villages, offering multi-faceted support for artists to embed themselves in rural settings, spark inspiration, and create spontaneously, truly merging art with local life.\n",

      "During their stays, the team researched and immersed themselves in local nature, culture, and traditional music, engaging in real-time exchanges with their environment and community, and improvising on-site multiple times. They visited local writer Zhou Gang, listened to his tales of Chuo Dunshan’s history, the Yushan literary gatherings of local sage Gu Aying, as well as the rise and fall of Kunqu opera performed by Huang Fanchuo and the region’s puppet theatre. The artists joined locals on morning field walks, chatted with elders, collected field recordings, and engaged in impromptu creation by the roadside—exploring and digging into culture from many perspectives, and integrating their creative process into daily rural life. “Interacting and improvising in different places creates a unique atmosphere; in our view, this is also a kind of natural state,” they said.

Han Bo, former media professional and now independent artist, has moved between media and art circles for years and recently began creating art himself. He believes that the more open one's mindset, the more one can discover the subtleties of traditional culture and create art that transcends reality on that basis.\n",

      "Worth noting, the Natural Arts Festival is not exclusive to young artists and scholars—it attracts broad citizen participation. At the opening ceremony, three open workshops were bustling with people, as both children and parents were eager to experience direct contact with nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the “Bamboo·Music” natural instrument workshop was led by Chen Zhipeng, a natural music mentor who traveled from Dali, Yunnan; he taught attendees how to craft simple instruments from bamboo and led impromptu musical performances. The workshop was so popular that a second session had to be added on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The local art workshop, led by the popular teacher Wu Yun, invited kids to read the Helin Society’s original picture book “Pickling Vegetables,” learning about customs in Jiangsu-Zhejiang and the tradition of pickling vegetables. Local plant expert Qiuqiu taught children to pickle vegetables hands-on—an intriguing activity for urban kids. Everyone chose their favorite fresh produce, rubbed it with salt, bottled it, and happily took their homemade pickles home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Green Field Workshop also attracted an unexpectedly large crowd. While many have eaten gorgon fruit, few have seen it fresh or know how to peel it. The team from Green Field, Kunshan, taught participants about the plant, showed fascinating photos, and let everyone try peeling it with copper finger tools, experiencing firsthand how “every grain comes with hardship.” Once peeled, the kids played interactive games and quizzes; everyone was able to sample a delicious, nourishing cup of fresh gorgon fruit syrup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lu Lu, founder of Helin Society and Artistic Director of the Natural Arts Festival, commented, “Although the Natural Arts Festival started with Helin Society, it far surpasses us. In the name of ideals, within the rules, we respect each other's wisdom and rights, and cross the boundaries between theory and method with our imaginations.”\n",

      "The establishment of a national park system is a major institutional innovation in China’s ecological civilization construction. Since the launch of national park system pilot projects in 2015, and the formal establishment of the first batch of five national parks—Sanjiangyuan, Giant Panda, Siberian Tiger and Amur Leopard, Hainan Tropical Rainforest, and Wuyi Mountain—in October 2021, China has basically put in place the “four beams and eight pillars” of the national park system.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"China is implementing a national park system with the purpose of maintaining the authenticity and integrity of natural ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, safeguarding the ecological security barrier, and leaving precious natural assets for future generations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This brand new system has enhanced ecological civilization awareness across society and created significant changes in the ecological environment and lifestyle: the diversity, stability, and sustainability of ecosystems have steadily improved; flagship species are continuously increasing in number; and the livelihood of the people has continuously improved—in the past, residents depended on exploiting the mountains, but now, they conserve and enrich the mountains, and lush mountains and clear waters have become their source of happiness.\n",

      "In the evening, autumn winds sweep over the source region of the Yellow River, and star-like lights shimmer on Zhaling Lake. Walking the grasslands, 37-year-old ecological ranger Dequjia often ponders: how can we protect the beauty of our homeland for the long term?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dequjia lives in Madoi County, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. This is the core area of the Yellow River source zone of Sanjiangyuan National Park, a vital ecological barrier on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the \"County of a Thousand Lakes,\" where lush water grass has nourished generations of grassland dwellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, due to global warming and overgrazing, by the early 21st century the grasslands had suffered severe desertification, the area of lakes shrank, and wild animals declined sharply... the ecosystem continuously deteriorated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the national park system pilot at Sanjiangyuan was launched. The \"one household, one post\" ecological protection policy was comprehensively implemented in the Yellow River source zone, gradually transforming herders into ecological guardians. Dequjia’s new identity became \"Protector of the Homeland\": \"We patrol the pasture at least three times a week, pick up litter, monitor and record wild animals, and exchange knowledge about grassland protection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, over 17,000 ecological rangers like Dequjia are spread across the sources of the Three Rivers, protecting their homeland through concrete actions. \"Being able to use our own efforts to make our homeland more and more beautiful is the wish of every herder,\" Dequjia said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2021, China’s first batch of five national parks, including Sanjiangyuan, was officially established.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since its establishment, Sanjiangyuan National Park has been continuously exploring the construction of a natural protection system, coordinating the implementation of black soil beach management, harmful organisms’ control, Yellow River Basin ecological protection and other ecological restoration projects, striving to build a complete, strong, effective, and precise management system,\" said Sun Lijun, Deputy Director of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the source of the Yellow River boasts majestic snowy mountains, lakes scattered like stars, and rare wildlife such as black-necked cranes and wild yaks making frequent appearances... The latest figures show that the ecological environment in the Sanjiangyuan area continues to improve: net increase in water and wetland ecosystems area by 309 square kilometers, average annual growth of water conservation capacity exceeds 6%, and biodiversity is steadily increasing.\n",

      "Ancient trees entwined with vines, mist curling along winding routes. Witnessing firsthand the withdrawal of mining enterprises, Hong Xiaojiang often sighs with emotion: \"This ‘treasure trove’ is now truly and strictly protected!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hainan’s tropical rainforest is rich in tropical biodiversity and genetic resources. In the past, local areas exploited natural resources in a disorderly manner for economic development needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the \"Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park System Pilot Program\" was issued, requiring the gradual closure and relocation of mining enterprises within the national park that did not meet conservation and planning requirements, and establishing a mechanism for the withdrawal of existing mining rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘What does the national park have to do with us?’ ‘Why remove the good ‘money trees’?’” Hong Xiaojiang, then head of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Administration Office, recalls the endless complaints and opposition at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, staff worked hard to persuade, held face-to-face discussions with enterprises, and coordinated on the frontlines of mining, eventually convincing the stubborn enterprises. By December 2021, all 10 mining rights within Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park had been cancelled and withdrawn, returning long-awaited tranquility to the rainforest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the exiting mining companies have largely completed ecological restoration in mining areas, and once pitted mountains are covered in new greenery. Dense forests, vibrant clouds, cascading waterfalls, increasingly distinct tracks of rare animals... what was once a dream-like rainforest sanctuary has become reality.\n",

      "\n",
      "Feng Limin is a deputy director at the National Forestry and Grassland Administration’s Siberian Tiger and Amur Leopard Monitoring and Research Center. According to him, for a long time, increased human activity led to the loss and degradation of wild Siberian tiger habitat and rapid population decline. By 1998, only 12 to 16 wild Siberian tigers remained in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, the country successively established nature reserves, stopped commercial logging of natural forests, and undertook measures like clearing snares, achieving some results. However, challenges remained: conservation work involved multiple departments and administrative regions, ecosystems were fragmented into separate blocks, and protected habitats were severely fragmented.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the pilot for Siberian Tiger and Amur Leopard National Park began, crossing Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, with administrative functions involving land, forestry, and five other departments handed over to the Park Administration. Forest vegetation restoration, withdrawal of production and living activities from core zones, construction of migration corridors for tigers and leopards… all these initiatives aimed to return the \"lordship\" of the forest to the tigers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, through an integrated sky-ground monitoring system, every move of the Siberian tigers and leopards can be watched in real time. The latest monitoring shows about 70 wild Siberian tigers and 80 wild Amur leopards are stably living within the park area, their range exceeding 11,000 square kilometers, or about 80% of the entire park.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just Siberian tigers and leopards; the habitat of \"national treasure\" giant pandas is also being systematically protected.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the past, due to natural and human factors, China’s giant panda population was fragmented into numerous small groups, living on isolated \"islands\" and hampering their growth and reproduction. By the end of 2013, there were 1,864 wild giant pandas across China, scattered into 33 local populations, 24 of which, due to small size, were at risk of extinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, Giant Panda National Park was officially established. To enhance genetic exchange, 10 ecological corridors have been planned in the Sichuan sector, including Tuo’wu Mountain, Niba Mountain, and Erlang Mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Sichuan sector focuses on key panda habitats and ecological corridors, carrying out nearly 54 square kilometers of ecological restoration, effectively protecting 64.8% of the country’s wild giant pandas,\" said Chen Zongqian, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Forestry and Grassland Administration.\n",

      "Li Wansong, a lifelong resident of Tongmu Village in Wuyishan, Fujian, never imagined his three jobs—tea garden owner, forest ranger, and homestay operator—would integrate so well. All this resulted from the establishment of Wuyi Mountain National Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wuyi Mountain National Park covers 1,280 square kilometers across Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Known for its rich biodiversity, it’s also the birthplace of world-renowned Oolong and black tea. The tea industry is a pillar here, and Li has managed his tea garden for over 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the years past, driven by economic interests, people often destroyed forests to grow tea, which damaged mountain ecosystems, reduced biodiversity, and weakened soil retention and air purification ability,” says Li. “Since the park was established, protection has intensified and deforestation for tea has been curbed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the idea that \"protecting the ecological environment is protecting our own home\" has become a consensus among Wuyi Mountain people. Following the park’s establishment, Li and villagers became forest rangers. “Now we use comprehensive ‘air, space, and ground’ monitoring management; our ecological protection capability is very strong,” Li says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park’s natural environment continues to improve: the Fujian sector’s forest cover has rebounded rapidly to 96.72%, and water and air quality meet national top standards. More than 30 new species, including the Wuyi forest frog and Wuyishan leaf orchid, have been discovered and announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "While safeguarding treasured ecosystems, the park actively promotes the integration of ecological protection, green development, and improved livelihoods. It guides tea farmers to build eco-friendly tea gardens, supports the fusion of tea culture, industry, and technology, and allows the people to share the ecological bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our ecological environment gets better and better—our village’s more than 9,000 mu (600 hectares) of tea gardens use no fertilizer and no pesticides. The quality is improving, and many first-time buyers become regulars,” Li says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protecting green mountains and clear waters is also bringing gold and silver mountains. Beyond tending tea gardens and patrolling forests, Li has converted his house into a homestay; each year there are more tourists, and rooms are sold out nearly every holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of national parks focuses on protection, but also on public participation and sharing. At present, the first batch of national parks, according to their unique natural and cultural endowments, offer many routes and areas open to the public. For example, Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park offers 10 premium eco-tourism trails and science corridors, and the Sichuan sector of Giant Panda National Park has planned three unique recreation routes and 11 mature recreation zones.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some voices express anticipation for Xiaomi’s renewed disclosure about the SoC chip, while others question whether Lei Jun’s introspection is sufficient. Over the past year, Xiaomi Group’s stock price rose from a low of HK$15.36 to a high of HK$59.45, but has seen volatility recently due to issues with its automobile business. Thanks to the diversified business foundation of Xiaomi Group and Lei Jun’s personal brand image, the secondary market has yet to see a large-scale, overly panicked sell-off. As of press time, Xiaomi shares trade at HK$51.05, up 1.79%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on everything at once leads to failure in the most important things. Lei Jun previously stated he is devoting about half his energy to the car business while allocating about one-third to mobile phones, as that is the foundation of Xiaomi. However, as both the smartphone and automotive sectors face cutthroat “red ocean” competition, how the leader divides his attention becomes crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout Xiaomi’s 15 years of operation, whether it’s the original “Eight Great Kings” (founders), later external executive hires, or the internally nurtured young talent pipeline, Lei Jun, as the symbolic figure of the group, has played a decisive role. To some extent, the Xiaomi brand has become synonymous with Lei Jun personally. But as intra-group competition intensifies for new ventures, Lei Jun—who once declared he had “bet his entire life’s fortune”—may need to consider that not every success must come down to “me.”\n",

      "A “completely unexpected” blow\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of February 29, an accident on Anhui De-Shang highway brought Xiaomi’s months-long high-profile automobile marketing campaign to a sudden halt. The official investigation into the traffic accident is still pending, and another controversy erupted over Xiaomi Auto’s alleged false advertising regarding its carbon fiber front hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, one of the core selling points for the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra was its carbon fiber dual-channel front hood, priced at 42,000 yuan. Official marketing touted its “replication of Nürburgring prototype aerodynamic design,” “increased downforce,” and “optimized heat dissipation.” But after owners tested their vehicles, they found that the hood’s ducts did not move a tissue, the internal structure was little different from a regular aluminum hood, it was not connected to the brake cooling system, nor did it produce the promised downforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing the problem of scaled-back features and inconsistencies with promotions, some owners launched a collective rights campaign, demanding returns and compensation. On May 7, Xiaomi Auto issued a public apology, admitting “unclear expression of information” and proposed a compensation plan: for undelivered orders, a free swap to an aluminum hood; for vehicles already delivered, a gift of 20,000 points (worth about 2,000 RMB).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the solution did not satisfy the owners: the post-delivery swap would require a new 30-week wait in the queue, the points compensated only represented 4.7% of the option’s price, and return requests were not addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Xiang, Director of the Vodafone Digital Automobile International Cooperation Research Center, told Yicai that some automakers, aiming for promotional effect, start advertising features before the car is even in mass production, with customers placing blind orders. Yet, the development and production process of such cars involves many uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of societal incidents have caused Lei Jun to pull back his marketing engagement on social media. In the May 15 review speech, Lei Jun stated: “At the end of March, a sudden traffic accident shattered everything. The company endured a torrential rain of doubts, criticism, and accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one expected the impact of this accident to be so great, nor the blow to Xiaomi to be so severe,” Lei Jun said. Public expectations and demands for Xiaomi have exceeded all imagination. “Xiaomi’s scale, influence, and public attention are now at a very high place. Society and the public require Xiaomi to bear the responsibility of being a true industry leader—a responsibility that cannot be avoided.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From safety measures to technical investment\n",
      "\n",
      "After the accident, Lei Jun said, he and top management, as well as the automobile department, held countless meetings, thinking about systematic problem-solving and how to respond to greater public expectations with more convincing operations and governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lei Jun did not clarify specific solutions, but summarized their approach as “technology first.” He said that Xiaomi announced five years ago that it would invest over 100 billion yuan in R&D over five years, with this year’s projected figure exceeding 30 billion. Meanwhile, Lei Jun publicly revealed that Xiaomi’s self-developed smartphone SoC chip Xuanjie O1 would be released by the end of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 16th, Lei Jun further reviewed Xiaomi’s history of chip development, stating it began in September 2014, with the first chip launch event in February 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Xiaomi established Pinecone Electronics to begin in-house chip development. After 28 months, it completed the full process of Surging S1 from project initiation, trial production to mass manufacturing, and launched it externally in 2017. Although the S1 adopted a 28nm production process, it still made Xiaomi the world’s fourth smartphone maker after Apple, Samsung, and Huawei to have proprietary in-house chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regrettably, an S2 chip did not follow as expected, and Xiaomi’s self-developed SoC disclosures have not progressed since. In March 2023, Xiaomi’s MIX FOLD foldable phone became its first to use a self-developed imaging processor chip, the Surging C1. The ISP was separated from the SoC, standing alone on the mother board. At that time, Lei Jun noted this was only a small step in Xiaomi’s ongoing quest for imaging expertise, and that seven years after its first chip, Xiaomi’s ambitions in chip-making had never ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lei Jun has previously emphasized what chip-making means for Xiaomi: many people consider it a near-impossible gamble, but Xiaomi insists on pursuing it. In his view, chips are the high ground of smartphone technology, and Xiaomi must master the core technology. To lead the market, long-term investment in chip technology is a must.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defending the mobile stronghold, charging into automotive rapids\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it’s self-developed chips or investment in auto safety, Xiaomi faces mounting pressure from all sides. Lei Jun, wearing many hats, is now challenged on two fronts: smartphone saturation and an automotive venture at the initial stage. Planning, prioritization, focus, and group resource allocation are now his most pressing issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, according to Canalys, fueled by government subsidies and the general consumer rebound, China’s mainland smartphone market moderately recovered in Q1 2025, with shipments up 5% year-on-year to 70.9 million units. Xiaomi’s shipments reached 13.3 million units, up 40% year-on-year. Benefiting from product and channel synergy, Xiaomi recaptured the No. 1 spot in the China mainland smartphone market with a 19% share, maintaining its goal to raise its domestic share by at least 1% annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, internationally, excluding domestic sales, Xiaomi’s overseas shipments dropped approximately 8.7% year-on-year. Canalys Chief Analyst Zhu Jiatao said: “Regional smartphone markets are getting complex. Previously fast-growing regions such as India, Latin America, and the Middle East have shown marked declines, reflecting saturation in mainstream product replacement demand. Most Android brands have been actively adjusting inventory in Q1 to avoid disruptions for new product launches and pricing systems. After a brief rebound, the European market slid again, hampered by high-end inventory hangovers and the impact of upcoming eco-design regulations on future mid- and low-end product lines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In China’s NEV (new energy vehicle) sector, regulators have proposed stronger market oversight and crackdowns on illegal marketing, but cutthroat competition hasn’t let up, and the price war rages on. According to insurance data shared by automotive expert Li Yanwei from the China Automobile Dealers Association, Xiaomi Auto sales have declined week-on-week for three consecutive weeks. Xiaomi PR General Manager Wang Hua said this should be assessed with cyclical factors in mind, but both phone and car businesses are at a pivotal point where outcomes depend on more than one person’s effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lei Jun, since Xiaomi formally announced its car venture, his focus has gradually shifted from phones to automobiles. But as he said in the 2024 annual speech: The Xiaomi SU7 only means Xiaomi Auto has finally sat at the table, but is still far from true success—its “Long March” has only just begun.\n",

The memorandum of understanding for the ALPHA project was signed by Telin CEO Budi Satria Dharma Purba and KT Senior Vice President Joon Myung. The two companies said they aim to complete the project planning this year, such as identifying the optimal next-generation technologies and system routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ALPHA cable system is expected to be put into service in the first quarter of 2027. President Myung stated, \"KT’s construction of the ALPHA cable is a crucial springboard to quickly meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud, big data, and AI traffic among enterprise customers in the fast-growing Asian region.\" He added that the company would also \"continue to expand its influence in the Asian submarine cable market by strengthening partnerships with like-minded global companies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both KT and Telin believe that the explosive growth in internet traffic across the region is the primary driving force for building a new intra-Asia cable connecting East Asia and Southeast Asia, regions where the largest traffic is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific. Citing data from 451 Research, these companies noted that over the next five years, data center capacity in Malaysia, Indonesia, and India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10-25%. These countries share several advantages, including growing online businesses, locally tailored content, and a youthful demographic structure. Telin hopes that, through cooperation with KT on the ALPHA cable system, Indonesia can become the central hub of intra-Asia interconnectivity.\n",

      "The depth and breadth of industrial synergy profoundly influence the quality and effectiveness of regional development, making it a key area for advancing coordinated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lian Yumíng, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president of the Beijing International Urban Development Institute, suggested turning the city sub-center into a bridgehead for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, and building a demonstration zone for integrated high-quality development between Tongzhou District and the Northern Three Counties, providing new space for industrial cooperation among the three areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The 14th Five-Year Plan period is a crucial stage for the transition and continuation of the coordinated development strategy for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. We should seek breakthroughs in three 'new' areas, making Beijing’s city sub-center the bridgehead for industrial synergy,\" said Lian Yumíng. \"First, we should accelerate the construction of a demonstration zone for integrated, high-quality development between Tongzhou District and the Northern Three Counties, providing new space for industrial collaboration. We need to further amplify the locational advantages of the Northern Three Counties, speed up the construction of a multilayered, multimodal, and seamlessly connected comprehensive transportation system. On the basis of forming a high-density commuter flow, we should further promote the interaction of business flow, information flow, capital flow, and technology flow, establishing closer economic and social ties between the two areas. More importantly, we should focus on creating a business environment with identical processes, requirements, and standards, accelerate the transformation and integration of government information systems, establish a data sharing and exchange system and a data resource sharing list, promote 'Internet+government services' and 'Internet+market supervision,' and achieve integrated business environments as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we should promote the establishment of a national-level green exchange with a global perspective, providing a new engine for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lian Yumíng suggested that the city sub-center should take the upgrading of the Beijing Green Exchange to a global national-level green exchange as a key goal, strengthen its functions as a carbon trading center, accelerate the development of green finance, innovate financial products, and support carbon peaking, carbon neutrality actions, and technological R&D. Leveraging this, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region could promote mutual flows of green capital, deep integration of green standards, and coordinated green energy industry planning, exploring coordinated governance for the \"dual carbon\" goals. On one hand, with carbon reduction as a strategic direction, it is necessary to coordinate pollution management, ecological protection, and overall climate change response, and to strengthen the synergy and efficiency of pollution and carbon reduction; on the other hand, it is important to harness the green energy advantages of Hebei and Inner Mongolia, strengthen the new energy industry through integrated planning, increase new energy substitution, and comprehensively promote the green transformation of economic and social development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we should promote joint innovation among the three Free Trade Zones (FTZs) to provide a new platform for industrial collaboration. According to Lian Yumíng, driving coordinated innovation among the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei FTZs should accomplish at least two key goals. First, by establishing a mechanism for ‘policy sharing, innovation co-promotion, and platform co-building,’ a new and higher-quality integration platform for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region can be formed, and institutional integration and innovation can drive collaborative industrial innovation. The three FTZs should promote mutual policy learning and reference, strengthen the replication and promotion of reform and innovation experiences, and jointly launch a number of innovative and leading FTZ reform achievements. Secondly, the institutional reform and mechanisms from the three FTZs should be extended to the hinterland regions, giving full play to their vast territory and market advantages, promoting the marketization and internationalization of factor allocation, and forming more competitive and influential industrial and supply chains in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\n",

      "(Reporter Jing Wenna reports) Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has focused on ensuring stable supply and price of key commodities related to people’s livelihoods. It has organized experts and industry associations to conduct in-depth analyses of the supply and demand of grains, edible oils, meat, eggs, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables for 2024, especially during the Spring Festival period. The NDRC has also strengthened dynamic market price monitoring and assessments of major product categories across regions, and, in cooperation with relevant departments, has convened special meetings to discuss supply and price stabilization during the Spring Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the NDRC has instructed all regions to make every effort to ensure stable market supply and price operation during the Spring Festival, creating a sound pricing environment for people to celebrate the holiday. First, it has emphasized strengthening supply organization, requiring localities to carefully assess trends in people movement, logistics, and weather during the holidays, and to conduct thorough consumption demand analyses. Major agricultural product wholesale markets and large supermarket chains are urged to fully leverage their roles in production-marketing coordination and advance stockpiling. Areas that may be affected by rain and snow are advised to further increase their inventory to safeguard smooth logistics. Second, reserve releases and fair-price sales are being carried out, with small-package grain and oil, pork, and vegetables to be released from reserves as needed based on market conditions; significant basic commodities will be sold at fair prices in accordance with local conditions to guide prices to remain at reasonable levels. Third, in terms of end-market supply, key supermarkets are required to stock shelves promptly in response to changing demand, and to reasonably allocate distribution staff to ensure smooth “last mile” delivery. Fourth, market regulation is being strengthened, with increased inspection of markets and prices, guiding relevant entities to conduct business in accordance with laws and regulations, and cracking down harshly on price violations to ensure smooth market operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, production of major livelihood commodities nationwide remains stable and positive, with ample market supply, providing a solid foundation for stabilizing supply and prices during the Spring Festival. In terms of grain and oil, grain production has reached another bumper harvest, with yields exceeding 1.3 trillion jin for nine consecutive years. Reserve stocks of finished grain and oil in 36 large and medium-sized cities are sufficient to meet more than 15 days of consumption. In terms of meat, eggs, and vegetables, pork and eggs are amply supplied, the area of vegetables in cultivation has steadily increased year-over-year, and winter-spring vegetable reserves in large northern cities can meet consumption for more than seven days.\n",

      "To build a strong nation, agriculture must first be strong; only through strong agriculture can the country be strong. Recently, the “Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Learning from and Implementing the Experience of the ‘Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation’ Project to Effectively and Forcefully Advance Comprehensive Rural Revitalization” was released. This marks the 12th No. 1 Central Document since the 18th CPC National Congress guiding work related to agriculture, rural areas, and farmers (“Sannong”). It once again sends a strong signal of placing importance on, and strengthening, agriculture, pointing out the direction and practical path for accelerating the building of an agricultural power and advancing comprehensive rural revitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Agriculture is the foundation of the world.” Over the past year, in the face of complicated domestic and international circumstances, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we have overcome multiple adverse impacts such as serious natural disasters. Grain production has achieved 20 consecutive bumper harvests, with output reaching a new historical high. Farmers’ incomes have grown rapidly. Rural society remains harmonious and stable, which has provided powerful support for promoting economic recovery and improvement, accelerating the establishment of a new development pattern, and promoting high-quality development. The most arduous and challenging tasks in the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country still lie in rural areas. Advancing Chinese-style modernization requires unremittingly consolidating the agricultural foundation and promoting comprehensive rural revitalization. To do a good job in “Sannong” work in the new era and on the new journey, rural revitalization must be the overarching focus. We must adhere to a people-centered development philosophy, fully and accurately implement new development concepts, fight a beautiful battle for rural revitalization, paint a new picture of livable and business-friendly beautiful villages, and promote the modernization of agriculture and rural areas to better advance Chinese-style modernization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To advance comprehensive rural revitalization, we must be guided by learning from and utilizing the experience of the “Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Renovation” project. While working in Zhejiang, General Secretary Xi Jinping personally planned and promoted this project. After more than 20 years of sustained effort, it has not only fundamentally transformed the rural landscape of Zhejiang, but also provided pioneering exploration and demonstration for comprehensive rural revitalization nationwide, lessons which can be learned and adapted in other regions. We should learn from the development philosophy, working methods, and promotion mechanisms embedded in the project, addressing pressing issues voiced by rural residents, identifying entry points for rural revitalization, tailoring efforts to local circumstances, striving for tangible results, and concentrating efforts to accomplish practical, visible, and tangible achievements for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advancing comprehensive rural revitalization requires firmly safeguarding two bottom lines: ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale return to poverty. With sufficient food supply in hand, one can remain calm. To ensure food security, we must make simultaneous efforts to maintain stable planting acreage and increase per unit yield, effectively mobilizing both farmers' enthusiasm for grain production and the initiative of local governments. We must focus on the production of grain and key agricultural products, steadily advance a new round of initiatives to increase grain capacity by 50 billion kilograms, establish a holistic protection system integrating the quantity, quality, and ecology of arable land, ensure grain output remains above 1.3 trillion jin, build a diversified food supply system, and make sure China’s rice bowl is held firmly in its own hands. Mechanisms for monitoring and assisting populations vulnerable to falling back into poverty must be enforced, with responsibilities solidified and consolidated, ongoing support for industries and employment reinforced, increased support for key areas, development conditions improved, endogenous development capabilities enhanced, and internal motivation stimulated, so as to consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation and ensure that large-scale return to poverty does not occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "To advance comprehensive rural revitalization, we should prioritize enhancing rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance. Villages are not only the spatial carriers of agricultural production but also the homelands where the majority of farmers are born and grow up. We must enhance the level of rural industrial development, promote the integrated development of primary, secondary, and tertiary rural industries, spotlight local specialty products, adhere to invigorating agriculture through industry, quality, and green development, and accelerate the formation of a modern rural industrial system that integrates multiple agricultural sectors, extends through production, processing, and sales, and fuses agriculture, culture, and tourism. We should improve rural construction by enhancing planning guidance, adapting to demographic trends, optimizing village layouts, industrial structure, and public service allocation, and coordinate new-type urbanization with comprehensive rural revitalization. To improve rural governance, we must promote rural revitalization through Party-building, flourish and develop rural culture, continue driving the transformation of rural customs, uphold and develop the “Fengqiao Experience” of the new era, and build peaceful villages. By systematically promoting rural industries, construction, and governance, and continually fostering a sound environment for living and working, we can ensure that the broad masses of farmers gain a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology is a powerful tool and reform is a vital asset for advancing comprehensive rural revitalization. We must strengthen the dual driving forces of science and technology as well as reform, optimize the strategic layout for agricultural scientific and technological innovation, intensify breakthroughs in core and key seed technologies, reinforce rural reform and innovation, and fully integrate reform measures to maximize their effectiveness, injecting new momentum and vitality into comprehensive rural revitalization. “National harmony rests upon widespread prosperity.” Increasing farmers’ income is the central task of agricultural and rural affairs. We must implement actions to promote income growth among farmers, continuously expand rural industries that enrich people, strengthen the linkage of industry development to farming households, enhance skills training for migrant workers, promote diversified employment of rural labor, and open up more channels for increasing income, so that farmers’ wallets get fatter and their lives get better.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China, and is a crucial year for achieving the objectives set out in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Doing well in work related to agriculture, rural areas, and farmers is a glorious mission and a great responsibility. Let us, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, anchor the goal of building an agricultural power, strengthen our confidence, muster energy, work hard and solidly implement the Party Central Committee’s decisions on agricultural and rural affairs, continue to achieve new successes in comprehensive rural revitalization, and steadily advance towards the goal of building a strong agricultural country.\n",

      "From April 14th to 15th, a project progress meeting was held at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, Hubei Province for the national key R&D Program’s “Low- and Medium-Yield Farmland” special project, focusing on the improvement of production capacity in southern red and yellow soil low- and medium-yield fields, projects for young scientists, and technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises. Academicians and consulting experts such as Zhang Jiabao, Kang Shaozhong, and Shao Ming’an attended the meeting. Project progress reports were presented around areas such as improving the output capacity of low- and medium-yield fields in the Yangtze River Basin, ameliorating acidic soils in southern China, and targeted regulation of soil constraints, with expert panel guidance and comments provided.\n",

      "National food security is not only the “static reserve” of yield, but even more so the “dynamic granary” of production capacity. Zhu Yongjin, Director of Agricultural Science and Technology at the Hubei Provincial Department of Science and Technology, stated that Hubei is currently promoting the improvement of low- and medium-yield farmland capacity in an orderly manner. Since the launch of the coordinated project between the ministry and the province, titled “Technology Models and Application for Improving the Capacity of Upland Red and Yellow Soils and Low- to Medium-Yield Paddies in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River,” a three-in-one technological system of “targeted diagnosis—dynamic regulation—intelligent decision-making” has achieved a leap from “treating the symptoms” to “addressing the root causes,” yielding a series of key outcomes. Going forward, comprehensive cycle-long services, full-scenario promotion, and whole-basin cooperation will be further strengthened. With Hubei as a hub, a big data platform for farmland in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be built, enabling data sharing, joint diagnostics, and collaborative research among five provinces, contributing “Hubei wisdom” to the high-quality development of agriculture along the Yangtze Economic Belt.\n",

This meeting is therefore of great significance. Efforts must be increased to publicize the work being done to improve the production capacity of low- and medium-yield farmland in both northern arid/semi-arid regions and southern red and yellow soil regions, and to apply the results achieved in actual agricultural production—genuinely ensuring national food security and effective agricultural product supply. In terms of talent cultivation, young scientists should not only focus on publishing papers, but more importantly, integrate with industry and agricultural production at the front line, contributing to the sector and becoming truly “grounded” scholars.\n",

      "In 2021, we deeply experienced the vigorous momentum brought by the wave of digitalization. As society accelerates toward becoming digitalized, networked, and intelligent, the importance of new information infrastructure—represented by IPv6—is increasingly salient. Over the past year, thanks to strong policy guidance and industry-wide collaboration, China achieved significant progress in large-scale IPv6 deployment: IPv6 traffic increased sharply, innovative applications based on IPv6 continued to emerge, and the “IPv6+” innovation system took shape at an accelerated pace. These advancements have strongly supported the development of a cyber power and Digital China, fueling the booming growth of the digital economy.\n",

      "Three-Year Plan Maps out IPv6 Large-scale Deployment Blueprint\n",
      "\n",
      "The year 2021 was a special one for China’s IPv6 development. That year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) officially released the “Three-Year Action Plan for IPv6 Traffic Increase (2021-2023)” (referred to as the “Three-Year Action Plan”), which clarified key development tasks for the next three years and marked China's entry into the “traffic increase” era of IPv6, following critical phases such as network readiness and end-to-end connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large-scale IPv6 deployment and application is an inevitable trend in the evolution and upgrading of the Internet, a key direction for network technology innovation, and crucial support for building a strong cyber nation. Since the release of the “Action Plan for Promoting the Large-scale Deployment of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)” by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in 2017, the MIIT has organized a series of special programs, including “IPv6 Network Readiness,” “End-to-End IPv6 Connectivity,” and “IPv6 Traffic Increase.” In July 2021, the MIIT formally released the “Three-Year Action Plan,” ushering in a new stage for the IPv6 industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Three-Year Action Plan” focuses on the overall goal of improving IPv6 traffic, outlining quantitative targets for areas such as network and application infrastructure service performance, IPv6 penetration in major commercial Internet applications, and the proportion of terminal devices supporting IPv6. For example, by the end of 2023, the proportion of mobile network IPv6 traffic is to increase from 20% in 2021 to 50%, and the IPv6 penetration rate of the top 100 Internet applications is to rise from 40% in 2021 to 70%. Industry experts believe the plan addresses critical challenges and pain points in IPv6 development with measurable targets, providing important guidance for industry progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement the Action Plan effectively, on August 25, 2021, the MIIT held a national deployment and policy briefing for the IPv6 Traffic Increase Three-Year Special Action, providing policy interpretation and deployment information across the industry. Representatives from the Communications Administration and industry regulators of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and more than 50 enterprises attended the meeting, building consensus and speeding up nationwide IPv6 deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2021, the MIIT issued a notice on the regulation and management of the 2400MHz, 5100MHz, and 5800MHz radio frequency bands, incorporating IPv6 support into the wireless router product approval requirements, thus addressing the “last 100 meters” in terminal upgrades for IPv6 traffic improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the same period, planning for IPv6 standards also entered a new phase. On September 1, 2021, under the guidance of the MIIT, Cyberspace Administration of China, National Development and Reform Commission, and State Administration for Market Regulation, the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) formed an IPv6 Standards Working Group. Industry insiders believe the founding of this working group will unite academia, industry, and research to accelerate IPv6 standardization at home and abroad, significantly advancing IPv6 technology and industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, in November 2021, the MIIT officially released the “14th Five-Year Plan for the Information and Communications Industry Development,\" which clearly states that during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), China will enhance end-to-end IPv6 capability, improve IPv6 network performance and service levels, and achieve simultaneous growth in both IPv6 user base and business traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial Collaboration Brings Remarkable Results for IPv6 Traffic Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "The release of the Three-Year Action Plan has inspired renewed confidence and enthusiasm across the industry to accelerate IPv6 “traffic improvement.” Guided by robust policy support, basic telecom operators, Internet companies, CDN providers, and terminal manufacturers have pushed forward IPv6 upgrades and transformation of networks, services, and terminals, with increasingly notable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since July 2021, the four major telecom operators (China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Broadcasting Network) have accelerated infrastructure upgrades. On top of fully completing IPv6 upgrades for 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband networks, they have continued to advance the transformation of data centers, CDN, and cloud networks, and, aligning with the deployment of dual-gigabit networks, they have expedited the replacement of outdated broadband terminals, helping boost IPv6 traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Internet and CDN companies such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and Wangsu Science & Technology have consistently promoted the IPv6 upgrade of cloud, IDC, and CDN infrastructures, expanding IPv6 support for their services. Companies including ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Meituan, Qihoo 360, and NetEase have continuously updated their apps to increase IPv6 penetration; terminal manufacturers like Xiaomi, New H3C, and Jixiang Tenda have focused on upgrading their commercialized and under-development products for IPv6 support.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the concerted efforts of the industry, China’s IPv6 “traffic increase” has achieved remarkable results. At the “2021 China IPv6 Innovative Development Conference” on October 11, 2021, Han Xia, Chief Engineer of the MIIT, announced to the industry that mobile network IPv6 traffic in China had increased from virtually zero to 22.87%, already exceeding the annual target ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest data show that, by the end of 2021, the proportion of IPv6 traffic on China’s mobile networks grew from 17.21% at the end of 2020 to 35.15%, and on fixed networks it grew from 4.3% to 9.38% over the same period—doubling in both sectors and surpassing all set targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration and Empowerment: The “IPv6+” Innovation Ecosystem Takes Shape\n",
      "\n",
      "While large-scale IPv6 deployment accelerates, IPv6 innovation is also gathering speed. The Three-Year Action Plan explicitly calls for a steady advance in “IPv6+” network and technology innovation. The “14th Five-Year Plan for the Information and Communications Industry” also points out that pilot projects for “IPv6+” innovative technologies and large-scale applications in finance, energy, transport, education, government affairs, and other key sectors should be supported to enhance IPv6’s role in driving industrial digital transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the entire industry sped up the development of the “IPv6+” innovation ecosystem, rolling out a series of breakthroughs nationwide. At the “IPv6+ Innovation City Summit Forum” held on September 10, Shanghai was designated as the “IPv6+ Innovation City”; by 2025, the city aims to establish a new generation information infrastructure renowned for its high speed, mobility, ubiquity, and intelligence. At the “6th IPv6+ Industry Forum” on September 27, SAIC Motor and China Telecom jointly released the “IPv6+ Industrial Intelligent Cloud-Network Technology White Paper.” In October, Wuhan took the national lead in initiating large-scale IPv6 deployment, accelerating the creation of an “IPv6+ Digital City.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To further promote IPv6 integration across industries, the first “Guanghua Cup” Gigabit Optical Network Application Innovation Competition, guided by the MIIT, was formally launched in October 2021, with “IPv6+” technology innovation application set up as a distinct category. In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China and MIIT launched pilot projects to integrate IPv6 technology and innovation, expediting the enabling role of IPv6 applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, “IPv6+” technologies have rapidly been applied in industries such as finance, education, healthcare, and energy, aiding the digital transformation of various sectors. For example, Guangdong Province has actively explored “IPv6+” on government extranet, establishing a benchmark for “IPv6+” government extranet at the provincial level across all scenarios; State Grid Jibei Electric Power Co., Ltd. was the first in the country to deploy “IPv6+” innovation technologies in its networks, greatly improving network autonomy and intelligence; more than 90 internet systems and core network 2.0 systems at China Construction Bank have been upgraded and put into production with “IPv6+” technology, greatly enhancing network delivery capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an essential \"network cornerstone\" in the digital economy era, large-scale IPv6 deployment is of great significance. Today, China’s IPv6 user base and network scale are among the world’s highest, and IPv6 traffic and service-carrying capabilities have also been greatly improved. With the comprehensive launch of the “traffic increase” era, China’s IPv6 development will accelerate even further, strongly supporting the digital transformation of all industries and injecting powerful momentum into building a cyber powerhouse and expanding the digital economy.\n",

On the 12th, Wu Qing, Party Secretary and Chairman of the CSRC, accepted an exclusive interview with reporters regarding the implementation of these opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Another 10 Years, the State Council Again Releases a Guiding Document for the Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How should we understand the importance of issuing these opinions?\n",
      "A: These newly released opinions by the State Council thoroughly implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions on the capital market and the arrangements set forth by the Central Financial Work Conference. As the third guiding document for the capital market in the past 10 years, following the previous releases in 2004 and 2014, they fully demonstrate the great importance and earnest expectations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the previous two \"Nine National Articles,\" this edition features several notable characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it fully embodies the political and people-oriented nature of the capital market. It stresses upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership over capital market work, persistently adhering to a people-centered value orientation, and more effectively protecting investors’—especially small and medium investors’—legitimate rights and interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it thoroughly focuses on the core themes of strong regulation, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development. The approach is to maintain stability as the keynote, reinforce the foundation, enforce strict regulation, and ensure that the high-quality development of the capital market better serves the overall economic and social development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it is highly goal-oriented and problem-driven. In particular, it targets prominent institutional, regulatory, and law enforcement issues revealed by stock market volatility since last August; it addresses weaknesses, strengthens shortcomings, responds to investor concerns, pushes to resolve long-standing systemic issues in the capital market, and accelerates the construction of a secure, standardized, transparent, open, dynamic, and resilient capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Opinions Set Progressive Development Goals for the Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How should we interpret the development goals for the capital market proposed for the coming period?\n",
      "A: The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made clear the goal to comprehensively advance national rejuvenation via Chinese-style modernization. The Central Financial Work Conference set forth the goal of building a strong financial nation. A robust capital market is a hallmark of a modern economy. Promoting high-quality development of the capital market helps foster high-level circulation among technology, industry, and capital, improve the modern industrial system, and support the growth of new quality productive forces. It also enriches financial products and services, creating more opportunities to increase residents’ property income, aids the development of equity financing, optimizes the financing structure, and perfects the modern financial system with Chinese characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"Nine National Articles\" focus on the central theme of Chinese-style modernization, anchor on the goal of building a strong financial country, and propose phased targets for capital market development by 5 years, 2035, and mid-century, outlining a blueprint in areas such as investor protection, listed company quality, industry institution development, supervision capabilities, and governance system construction. We understand that these development goals are systematic, comprehensive, and progressive, requiring unwavering commitment to market-oriented and law-based reform, respecting rules and discipline, implementing step by step, and turning the blueprint into reality with persistence and resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Implementing Framework Will Form a \"1+N\" Policy System\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How will the CSRC systematically advance and implement the policy measures proposed in the opinions?\n",
      "A: The new \"Nine National Articles\" employ systematic thinking, balancing near- and long-term, and work in tandem with the CSRC’s implementation arrangements, forming a \"1+N\" policy system. \"1\" stands for the core opinions document, and \"N\" refers to supporting institutional rules. Last month, we already released four supporting policy documents covering IPO standards and ongoing supervision of listed companies. Today, we will also release a policy file on strengthening delisting supervision and solicit public opinion on six specific institutional rules. The stock exchanges are likewise soliciting opinions on a batch of self-regulatory rules. Next, after further research, we will formulate reform measures to promote the long-term development of the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main thread of the \"1+N\" policy system is strong supervision, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development. This is an interdependent and organic whole that must be advanced integrally and systematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "On strong supervision, we will build a comprehensive, multi-dimensional capital market regulatory system and implement the concept of regulation being “sharp and tough.” Supervision of listed companies will emphasize full-chain oversight and the enhancement of listed company investment value, with sustained efforts on strict IPO screening, ongoing supervision, and intensifying delisting oversight. Institution supervision will focus on returning to core functions, becoming better and stronger, further reinforcing the “gatekeeper” responsibility, guiding securities, futures, and fund institutions to uphold proper business philosophies, improve compliance, professional service capabilities, and core competitiveness. We will actively cultivate rational, value, long-term investment concepts and a healthy investment culture. Trade supervision will aim for fairness and efficiency, standardize behaviors of all market participants and funds, crack down on illegal and irregular practices that disrupt the market, and maintain a publicly fair and just order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of risk prevention, we will introduce a series of mechanisms and policy initiatives, such as maintaining stable market operations, preventing and resolving key risks, improving expectation management mechanisms, and coordinating openness and security. In particular, we will enhance the inherent stability of the capital market, improve risk monitoring and handling mechanisms, and focus on stabilizing confidence and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For high-quality development, we will thoroughly implement the Central Financial Work Conference’s requirements on performing the “five major articles” on finance, further improve the multi-tiered capital market system, enhance adaptability and inclusiveness of capital market institutions, promote capital formation, and better serve innovation in new industries, models, and technologies, thereby effectively fostering new quality productive drivers. Currently, we are conducting comprehensive assessments of capital market reform, widely soliciting opinions, refining related systems, and pushing for the continual deepening of key reforms such as the stock issuance registration system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Establishing Effective Governance Based on Co-construction, Joint Governance, and Shared Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Promoting high-quality development of the capital market requires collective effort. What arrangements do the opinions make in this area?\n",
      "A: The capital market has numerous participants and complex operational mechanics. In a healthy market ecosystem, institutional and individual investors grow together; both long-term and short-term funds find their place; issuers and investors achieve mutual success; each party assumes its due responsibility, and supervision interacts positively with the market. Achieving this requires all sides to balance investment and financing, primary and secondary markets, entry and exit, on-exchange and off-exchange relationships, to form effective governance where everyone participates, governs, and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"Nine National Articles\" make arrangements on many key aspects. For example, to promote the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market, they stress not only the robust development of equity-based public funds—the “mainstay”—but also focus on creating an environment where insurance, social security, and pension funds can enter and thrive, with differentiated deployment policies. The opinions also emphasize strengthening the rule of law, substantially increasing the cost of capital market infractions, improving the cross-administrative, criminal, and civil accountability system, and introducing numerous hard measures. We are confident that, as long as we continue to grasp these matters, the capital market will become ever more stable and orderly. The opinions also mandate the deepening of central-local and inter-departmental coordination. We will continue to enhance our collaboration with all parties to form a strong joint force for high-quality capital market development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a Highly Capable, Politically Strong, Disciplined Regulatory Team\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: The opinions and related CSRC documents call for strengthening the CSRC's internal construction. What are the specific measures in this respect?\n",
      "A: To forge iron, one must be strong oneself. The new \"Nine National Articles\" sets out clear requirements for enhancing the construction of the regulatory team, and we have issued relevant arrangements. We will place even greater emphasis on political development, continue to consolidate and expand the outcomes of learning and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and thoroughly advance strict Party governance. With the resolve to \"cut to the bone,\" we will fully implement the requirements for tough regulation and management, so that strict self-governance drives strict regulatory work.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will strengthen coordination with the resident disciplinary inspection and supervision group, solidly advance rectification of Central inspections, focus on eradicating the soil from which corruption arises, and comprehensively promote the “do not dare, cannot, and do not want to engage in corruption” principle. For widely watched issues such as the \"revolving door\" between government and business and evasive resignations, we have already introduced over 20 measures with a comprehensive approach to both business and management. Special governance in this area will continue and go deep, tolerating no leniency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we are committed to building a regulatory \"iron army\" that is politically steadfast, highly capable, and possesses a rigorous work ethic, providing a strong guarantee for strong supervision, risk prevention, and high-quality development of the capital market.\n",

      "Dr. Wong Yat-wa, the Head of the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at Queen Mary Hospital, has previously served as the Deputy Hospital Chief Executive. During his involvement in hospital administration, he has made significant contributions by working to provide better and faster medical services for the public. The waiting time for new, stable cases at orthopaedic specialist outpatient clinics in the Hong Kong West Cluster has been reduced from over 160 weeks in 2018 to around 90 weeks recently, with nearly half of the patients able to see a doctor within 16 to 20 weeks. Dr. Wong explained that the hospital prioritizes patients based on the severity of their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "When patients seek medical attention at the hospital, they may require care from more than one specialty. Through measures such as one-stop clinics, nurse follow-ups for discharged patients, and flexible allocation of manpower for surgeries and specialty outpatient clinics, Dr. Wong said that with multi-faceted coordination, the number of patient visits is reduced, which in turn shortens overall waiting times.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, when patients showed suspected orthopaedic symptoms, “We used to send someone over, which wasted a lot of time going back and forth,” said Dr. Wong. In 2021, a pilot joint cross-specialty video consultation was introduced, where family medicine doctors and orthopaedic specialists provide clinical advice to patients via video consultation. After assessment, non-urgent cases are followed up at family medicine specialist clinics, while severe cases are referred directly to orthopaedic outpatient clinics. “We can also see more patients, and with the click of a button, connect to consultations,” he said.\n",

      "On November 5, Palestinian President Abbas met with Blinken in Ramallah in the West Bank. He called for an immediate halt to the “devastating conflict” and an acceleration of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including medical supplies, food, water, electricity, and fuel. Abbas stated that Israel must take full responsibility for the current situation and emphasized that military means will not bring security to Israel; only by ending Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories can peace be achieved.\n",

      "Blinken stated that the United States firmly supports Israel’s right to self-defense, and that a ceasefire would only give Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, an opportunity to regroup and launch further attacks on Israel. He reiterated the U.S. position, which is for the Israeli military to temporarily ceasefire and implement what is called a “humanitarian pause” to allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the evacuation of foreign nationals, while still being able to “achieve the goal of defeating Hamas.”\n",

      "Peng Hao, Deputy Party Secretary and General Manager of Northwest Institute, commented that the world is undergoing unprecedented changes. A surge in technological and industrial transformation brings intersectoral innovation to the fore. The Chang’an Le Belt and Road Cultural Exchange Center, designed by national master architect Zhao Yuanchao, is an exemplar of cross-domain innovation, fusing culture, art, leisure, commerce, and ecology into a complex art center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vice Chairman Wen Qinglin and Director Chang Xinping also gave enthusiastic speeches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Master architect Zhao Yuanchao delivered a report titled \"Music Starts in Chang’an—Reflections on Urban Order and Character,\" discussing the synergy between urban development and architectural design, and ways to foster continuing cultural and historical heritage through innovative design. He emphasized that architecture now transcends the focus on function and aesthetics of a single building, instead considering its role within urban spatial context and reinforcing urban cultural character. He advocated for modern architecture that reflects regionalism yet is modernized, a philosophy realized in multiple Xi’an projects. As a historic city, Xi’an can use thoughtful design and planning to inject new vitality and functionality while preserving tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chang’an Le project integrates cultural, leisure, commercial, and ecological functions. Its design draws inspiration from the traditional musical instrument \"Xun,\" abstracting its form into the architecture, endowing the complex with unique character as Xi’an’s new cultural landmark. The project encompasses a total area of 143,000 square meters, including a grand theater (2,049 seats), concert hall (1,500 seats), multipurpose hall (511 seats), and cinema (650 seats). These venues satisfy diverse performance needs as well as various conferences and social activities, embodying multifunctional design. Modern building technologies and materials blend with traditional essence, and the exterior harmonizes through color and material with the surrounding cityscape, reinforcing cultural expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhao’s insights provide valuable ideas for urban planning and architectural design—especially for cities rich in heritage—on achieving a balance between preservation and development to create contemporary cultural and living spaces.\n",

      "Professor Li Guoqi from Beijing University of Technology introduced the stage technology design, which includes a two-layer main lift stage, side stages, and advanced lighting to support complex scene changes and dynamic effects, ensuring visual and audio impact at every performance. The stage uses the latest LED screens and digital mixers, enhancing audiovisual effects. Highly automated machinery and emphasis on safety, technology, and intelligence were highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Han Jintao, from Beijing Beite Shengdi Technology Development Co., analyzed the transition of Chang’an Le from a standard theater to a show venue. He noted that since 2000, China’s theater construction has accelerated, moving towards specialization. He highlighted outdoor experiential shows and non-standard theaters, such as Wuxi's \"Taihu Show\" with a 360° rotating, rising, and tilting water stage, and Xinjiang Grand Theater’s \"A Thousand Returns to the Western Regions.\" In \"Boundaryless Chang’an,\" theater space was used with high flexibility, presenting innovative stage technology and visual effects, blending intangible cultural heritage with modern art to enhance the audience experience and drive the culture industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Yongmin, General Manager of Shanghai Zhang Kuisheng Acoustic Engineering Consulting, analyzed the acoustic design and sound quality of the 1,500-seat concert hall. The innovative island-style stage and wraparound seating, together with acrylic sound reflectors suspended from the ceiling, create optimum sound diffusion. Both objective tests and subjective listening showed that key parameters like reverberation time and clarity meet world-class standards, confirming the project's success as a modern cultural landmark and international platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ding Weizhou, executive director and general manager of Xi’an Performing Arts Group Theater Operations, and chairman and GM of Xi’an Chang’an Le Operations, shared operational experience. Through citywide multi-media publicity and self-media plus new media promotion, they encouraged customer word-of-mouth. Inviting international ensembles, hosting project launches, press conferences, open days, and influencer testing, they created a ’24-hour art living center’. Interdisciplinary cooperation and integration of social, cultural, artistic, and interactive business genes have made Chang’an Le an important local landmark, enriching public experience and advancing culture-business development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhu Yilei, deputy chief architect of China Zhongyuan International Engineering, shared European cases of multipurpose venues, focusing on flexible designs such as Reutlingen’s multipurpose hall (supporting symphony concerts, conferences, banquets, with variable seating and adjustable stage-audience relationship), as well as Munich’s Isarphilharmonie and Lucerne Culture and Congress Center, which stress the significance of acoustic modulation. These venues, through innovative design and technology, cater to traditional and modern, urban multi-use needs, indicating new directions for future performing arts spaces.\n",

      "   Flip Camera Smartphones  \n",
      "   Since the rear camera on most phones generally outperforms the front camera, but users have a strong need for high-quality selfies, the challenge became how to provide the front camera with a larger sensor within the limited space of a smartphone while also controlling costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In September 2013, OPPO released the OPPO N1, a smartphone equipped with a camera module that could freely rotate 206 degrees. This phone had only a single 13MP rear camera, but by rotating the module, users could use the rear camera to take selfies. As a result, the phone was very popular among female consumers at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Phone with the Most Cameras  \n",
      "   The Nokia 9 PureView featured five cameras, arranged in a circle along with a flash and a depth sensor—visually leading many to mistakenly believe it had seven cameras. All five had identical specs: a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 lens. Unlike other multi-camera setups, there were only two color cameras; the other three were monochrome. When taking a photo, all five cameras shot images at different exposures simultaneously, which were then merged into a high-detail composite. This solution, co-developed with Light, the makers of the Light L16 camera, used Light's Lux Capacitor camera control chip to manage the five cameras. In theory, this enabled more detail and better color, but in practice, it resulted in slow photo processing—sometimes requiring PC software to fully realize the image quality, which was awkward and inconvenient.\n",

      "   Pop-up Camera Smartphones  \n",
      "   At one time, the industry was fiercely debating the use of notched screens versus full-view displays. OPPO then offered a new solution: the pop-up camera module.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Find X, released in June 2018, had its front and rear camera modules designed as a single unit that could mechanically rise and retract from the body. When not in use, the module was entirely hidden inside the phone, allowing for a truly notchless “full-view display” with ultra-narrow bezels at the top and bottom. When closed, the back was a seamless piece of glass—sleek and elegant. This bold, minimalist design was a significant innovation.\n",

Based on the Galaxy S4 Mini, it uniquely featured a 10x (24-240mm) optical image-stabilized zoom lens with a 1/2.33\" 16MP BSI CMOS sensor. When in use, the lens extended out like a standalone camera, providing a genuine camera feel.\n",

In 2018, they launched the massive and heavy RED Hydrogen One smartphone, featuring a glasses-free 3D holographic display, a large battery, a unique rippled frame, modular connectors for professional attachments, and a striking back design. Although its build and specs were high-end, its core selling point—the 3D screen—received much criticism due to limited usage scenarios and a scarcity of viewable content.\n",

      "\n",
      "   The novelty of a portable projector was compelling, but the module’s size could not be further reduced, resulting in a 12.5mm thick phone.

This allowed different functions on each screen—for example, in horizontal mode for viewfinding and vertical for camera controls when taking photos. In gaming, you could display the game on the main screen with controls on the secondary. In practice, however, software incompatibility resulted in frequent bugs or malfunctions, leading to its eventual discontinuation.\n",

      "   The BlackBerry Passport, notable for its rare square display combined with a full physical keyboard, appeared awkward and bulky. Released in 2015, it was ignored by most consumers by then, as the touchscreen era was unstoppable. It became the last BlackBerry to run their own OS, after which they switched to Android for future phones.\n",

Some of these design philosophies still appear unique today and, in hindsight, even a little regrettable. Technology always advances through countless explorations and experiments, maturing after many failures.

      "Last night, my husband was installing a newly bought small cabinet in the kitchen, and I was helping him out. My husband kept asking for a screwdriver one moment and a wrench the next, making me run around like a spinning lantern, constantly having to run to the toolbox on the balcony to find things for him. Later, finding it too troublesome, I simply opened up the toolbox and placed it at the kitchen doorway for my husband to help himself. Our little cat had never seen such a scene before and ran over to crawl in and out of the toolbox, having quite a blast. Every time my husband took a tool, he had to first move the cat aside, and he wouldn't forget to pet its head and play with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our daughter was originally sitting at the kitchen doorway watching her dad install the cabinet, but before long she ran off pouting to play with her phone. Seeing that our daughter seemed quite aggrieved, I went over to pat her head and asked, \"Why aren't you watching the excitement anymore? Did your dad scold you?\" Our daughter put down her phone to complain: \"I was just curious and casually looked through the toolbox, but he said I was causing trouble.\" I comforted our daughter: \"Then let's just rest for a while, as if we really care to watch him.\" Our daughter pointed at the little cat with an indignant face and said, \"But it even crawled into the box, and dad keeps praising it for being cute. Why is it that I can't even touch it?\" I glanced at my husband who was absorbed in playing with the cat, then looked at the meowing little cat, and finally at our daughter with her stern face. I thought to myself, my child, from mother's observation, this matter seems to have nothing to do with whether or not you touch the toolbox. Rather, it has something to do with whether or not you know how to act cute. Why don't you try acting cute while going through your dad's toolbox?\n",

      "Whether in theory or practice, new quality productive forces are an intellectual achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the scientific concept of new quality productive forces during his inspection in Heilongjiang, and subsequently elaborated on it on multiple occasions, particularly providing systematic exposition during collective study sessions of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Overall, the proposal of new quality productive forces represents an innovation and development of Marxist theory of productive forces, constitutes the latest achievement of Xi Jinping Thought on the Economy, serves as an innovative core concept in socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics, represents a clarion call of the times issued at the critical moment of advancing Chinese-style modernization, and constitutes a strategic deployment for building a strong country and achieving the great cause of national rejuvenation. Whether in theory or practice, new quality productive forces are an intellectual achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history. To further deepen our understanding of it, we must grasp several perspectives and entry points.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the classical definition of productive forces in Marxist political economy. In classical Marxism's view, laborers, means of production, and objects of labor constitute the three elements of productive forces. The historical development and dialectical unfolding of these three elements contain the developmental logic of new quality productive forces. From the practice of economic and technological development, we can see that objects of labor connect with new materials and new energy sources, means of production connect with informatization, artificial intelligence, high-end precision equipment, etc., and laborers connect with professional talents and industrial teams in the era of informatization and intelligence. This point can also be understood in connection with Lenin's discussion of labor productivity. The comprehensive penetration of science and technology in productive force elements and the improvement of labor productivity are natural extensions of the innovation of productive force elements. Marx regarded means of production as the main marker for dividing historical epochs, discussing the difference between hand mills and steam engines. In reality, both objects of labor and laborers have qualitative characteristics specific to their times. Lenin regarded labor productivity as the fundamental criterion for socialism to defeat capitalism, essentially incorporating science and technology into the productive forces system. This enlightens us that each era has new quality productive forces belonging to that era. Therefore, the concept of new quality productive forces is one with universal significance that can be fully incorporated into the Marxist political economy and productive forces theory system, possessing great theoretical significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the historical process of our Party's theoretical innovation since reform and opening up. In the most general sense, productive forces theory is theory about development. Since reform and opening up, through arduous exploration in theory and practice, our Party has achieved a series of major innovative achievements in productive forces theory. On the new journey of building a strong country and achieving national rejuvenation, General Secretary Xi Jinping's proposal of the concept of new quality productive forces represents a major integration and synthesis of our Party's productive forces theory. Placing new quality productive forces in such a continuous lineage enables us to understand more profoundly the historical significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the ever-changing technological revolution. The technological revolution and the profound changes it brings constitute the main theme of our times. General Secretary Xi Jinping's proposal of new quality productive forces represents a high-level condensation and innovative development of historical experience, indicating that our Party's understanding of the technological revolution and its laws has reached new heights. The focus of new quality productive forces is on \"new,\" the key lies in \"quality,\" and productive forces represent the general theoretical connotation. \"New\" and \"quality\" are the temporal proposition and special requirements. Combined together, they constitute an organic whole of theoretical innovation, encompassing both the general requirements for developing productive forces and the special requirements for seizing opportunities in the technological revolution, pointing out existing bottlenecks and shortcomings in China's modernization construction, and clarifying the focus and pathways for solving problems. This theoretical achievement of new quality productive forces enriches and perfects the value function of Chinese-style modernization. From this, we can deeply appreciate the great power of the leader's thought, appreciate General Secretary Xi Jinping's theoretical courage and mission commitment, and appreciate the contemporary significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the world pattern of great power competition and China-US rivalry. Great power competition is a movement of forces, with various forces maneuvering vertically and horizontally, waxing and waning, pulling and constraining each other, shaping the world pattern of a given era, among which certain great power relationships must play a decisive role. Science and technology, especially high-tech, determine human destiny and national fortune, representing truly \"matters of great national importance\" that must be carefully observed. For a period after the founding of New China, the focus was on nuclear technology, and we developed \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" on the foundation of poverty and blankness. Now it's information technology, artificial intelligence, new materials, new energy, life sciences, etc. We are catching up, but still have a long way to go. Great power competition depends not only on scale but more on quality, not only on total volume but more on structure, not only on stock but more on increment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the contradictory movement between productive forces and relations of production. The contradiction between productive forces and relations of production is Marxism's basic conception of social movement. These two elements are in eternal dialectical movement, and transforming society fundamentally involves liberating and developing productive forces through reforms in relations of production. Our revolution, reform, development promotion, and modernization advancement constitute a grand article. Over the past 40-plus years, we have relied on reform and opening up, this crucial move determining contemporary China's destiny, to change China's appearance, the appearance of the Chinese people, the appearance of the Chinese nation, and the appearance of the world. Cultivating and developing new quality productive forces requires even more reliance on this crucial move of reform and opening up. Currently, there remain many institutional, mechanical, and structural obstacles that influence and constrain talent cultivation, technological innovation, and the development of new quality productive forces. People have many complaints about existing drawbacks in talent cultivation models, science and technology management systems, technological innovation environments, achievement evaluation systems, intellectual property protection, and scientific and technological opening to the outside world, with urgent demands for change. The proposal of new quality productive forces provides us with a rare historical opportunity and practical entry point for solving these problems and advancing higher-quality reform and higher-level opening up, containing sophisticated leadership artistry and methodological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the new journey of building a modern strong country and achieving the second centenary goal. The timely completion of the first centenary historical task provides a solid foundation and new historical starting point for realizing the magnificent blueprint drawn by the 20th Party Congress. The proposal of new quality productive forces provides a new logical starting point and theoretical fulcrum for the new journey. China has ranked as the world's second-largest economy for many years, but many industries still remain at the middle and lower ends of industrial chains, with gaps mainly in core competitiveness. International competition in today's world is competition in science and technology and talents, essentially competition in high-quality productive forces levels. Those with superior technology are strong; those with superior quality win. The proposal of new quality productive forces sounds the charge toward high-quality development.\n",

Lam Pui-yan, Vice President of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, pointed out that although Hong Kong has nearly 10,000 TCM practitioners, relatively few have served in the public healthcare system, and most are not well-acquainted with ward environments, methods of integrating Chinese and Western medicine, and clinical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"TCM practitioners with hospital hands-on experience are relatively rare in Hong Kong,\" said Lam Pui-yan. While relevant talent can be recruited from the mainland, this is only a temporary measure. In the long term, local talent in this area must be cultivated. \"We should leverage the expertise of senior mainland TCM practitioners to help train Hong Kong TCM practitioners. Training should not only impart knowledge and skills, but also provide practice in appropriate environments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lam Pui-yan stated that the first step is to allow TCM practitioners to work and receive training in public hospital wards. \"If we rely only on face-to-face teaching or textbook content, we cannot cultivate TCM practitioners with practical experience. After all, healthcare is clinical practice work, and it's difficult to master through reading alone.\" She pointed out that Hong Kong has three universities offering full-time bachelor's degree programs in Chinese medicine, and students currently need to complete several months of internship at mainland Chinese medicine hospitals to gain clinical experience. \"We hope that in the future, students can go to wards in public hospitals under the Hospital Authority. Additionally, courses should include content on how Chinese and Western medicine can collaborate, as well as relevant examination training, to enrich the clinical experience of the new generation of Chinese medicine students.\"\n",

These tangible livelihood achievements obtained by Shouguang City Procuratorate in Shandong Province through case handling have won sincere praise from the public. Song Jiaode, Chief Prosecutor of the procuratorate, stated: \"We will continue to use 'procuratorate serving the people and doing practical things' as our approach, focusing on the urgent, difficult, worrying, and hoped-for needs of the masses, and use the power of the rule of law to protect people's rights and interests.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "In July 2022, elevators in a certain residential complex frequently malfunctioned. After property owners submitted repair applications, the property management company informed them that because the developer had not transferred the residential special maintenance funds to the special supervisory account of the housing and construction department, property owners would need to pay for elevator repairs themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 22 property owners had clearly paid residential special maintenance funds to the developer when purchasing their homes 10 years ago, so why did they still need to pay out of pocket for elevator repairs? After multiple unsuccessful communications between Zhang and other 22 property owners and the developer, the property owners' rights protection efforts reached an impasse. Subsequently, Zhang and others came to the 12309 Procuratorial Service Center of Shouguang City Procuratorate seeking help. After understanding the details, prosecutor Zhang Yongzhi, who received them, suggested that Zhang and others could file a lawsuit in their personal capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the court ruled in favor of the property owners, the developer delayed fulfilling the judgment. Shouguang City Procuratorate continued to follow up and supervise, jointly researching solutions with courts, housing and construction departments, and financial departments. Ultimately, the court used the property quality guarantee funds that the developer had previously deposited in the financial bureau's account as the execution target, and timely transferred them to the special account for residential special maintenance funds of the housing and construction department, supporting the parties' demands and avoiding escalation of conflicts.\n",

      "Based on handling this case, Shouguang City Procuratorate issued social governance procuratorial recommendations to the housing and construction department, urging them to improve and perfect the management mechanism for residential special maintenance funds, strengthen digital supervision, and increase publicity efforts for residential special maintenance fund policies. The housing and construction department promoted the standardized and orderly use of residential special maintenance funds through upgrading and transforming the digital management system for residential special maintenance funds and conducting policy briefings.\n",

      "Fighting Against False Litigation\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2023, the civil procuratorial department of Shouguang City Procuratorate discovered a case clue in the course of performing their duties, which led to uncovering a false litigation case involving nearly one million yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, a trading company signed a steel trading contract with a construction company, agreeing that the trading company would supply steel of specified brands. During the supply period, the construction company discovered that some steel brands did not conform to the contract specifications and requested supplementary delivery. However, Yang, the person in charge of the trading company, not only failed to make up the 53 tons of steel but also conspired with Liu, the project manager of the construction project, to forge false certificates, fraudulently increasing the debt by 450,000 yuan, and filed a lawsuit in court in June 2022. The court's first-instance judgment ordered the construction company to pay over 950,000 yuan in payment for goods, including payment for 53 tons of steel that were not actually supplied. Because the construction company did not appeal, the judgment became effective and was executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This case seemed ordinary, but there were obvious contradictions between the receipt documents submitted by the parties and the supply records, especially the detail that they claimed to have fulfilled their obligations despite not completing the supplementary delivery, which very likely constituted false litigation,\" said Cao Weidong, the handling prosecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors verified details about supply and receipt one by one by reviewing case files and questioning key witnesses, ultimately uncovering the fact that Yang had forged goods receipt documents to increase payment and filed a lawsuit in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "False litigation not only damages corporate interests but also erodes judicial credibility. Yang's behavior constituted suspected false litigation, leading to errors in factual determination in the judgment, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of the enterprise, and disrupting judicial order. The procuratorate therefore requested a protest to Weifang City Procuratorate on May 5, 2023. On August 2, Weifang City Procuratorate filed a protest with Weifang Intermediate People's Court. On November 24, Weifang Intermediate People's Court ordered Shouguang City Court to retry the case. On July 12, 2024, Shouguang City Court made a retrial judgment, reducing the amount by nearly 400,000 yuan compared to the original trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the false litigation behavior of Yang and the trading company, the procuratorial organs simultaneously issued procuratorial recommendations to the court. Ultimately, the trading company was fined 100,000 yuan, and Yang was subjected to fifteen days of judicial detention, effectively deterring litigation misconduct.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Phone bill and electricity bill recharges enjoy 70% discounts...\" The seemingly cost-effective \"slow charging discounts\" could very likely become tools for criminals to \"launder\" stolen money.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, when Shouguang City Procuratorate was handling a case of concealing and hiding criminal proceeds, the handling prosecutor discovered that the criminal group had built a \"slow charging platform\" to attract consumers to place orders with low-price recharges, then batch-charged illegally obtained funds from telecom fraud and online gambling into user accounts, and ultimately transferred stolen money through virtual currency, forming a complete chain of \"turning black money white.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing challenges such as anonymous operations and dispersed fund flows, the procuratorate relied on big data to conduct source tracing and tracking, and jointly established a special case team with public security and financial regulatory departments. After months of work, they locked down key evidence, successfully prosecuted 11 criminal suspects, and recovered over 4 million yuan in stolen money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Criminals exploit people's psychology of seeking bargains, 'laundering' illegal funds through phone bill and electricity bill recharges, even spreading to water bills, fuel cards, shopping cards, game coins, live streaming tips and other areas, causing great harm,\" said Bu Xianhui, a prosecutor in the Economic Crime Procuratorial Department of the procuratorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To crack the problem of long criminal chains and difficulty in evidence collection in \"slow charging money laundering,\" the case handling team used big data technology to analyze platform transaction flows layer by layer, precisely locking down the destination of stolen money. Since last year, Shouguang City Procuratorate has handled 3 cases involving 18 people for using phone bill and electricity bill \"slow charging\" to conceal and hide criminal proceeds, recovering 7.138 million yuan in stolen assets.\n",

      "Spanning five thousand years, where does the name \"China\" come from? In the vast ocean of classics and cultural relics, can we find the earliest origin of \"China\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, President Xi Jinping's first domestic inspection visit was to the Yinxu ruins in Anyang, where he emphasized that archaeological work should continue to receive attention and strengthening, and the Chinese Civilization Tracing Project should be further deepened. Archaeology not only answers the profound question of \"where we come from and where we are going,\" but also provides the contemporary answer to \"what makes China.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a small space, one can glimpse a thousand years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yinxu ruins where \"a piece of oracle bone astonished the world,\" the Liangzhu ruins which provide \"five-thousand-year evidence of Chinese civilization,\" the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang known as the \"Pearl of the Silk Road\"...\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, during various inspection and research trips, General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly visited museums, memorial halls, and cultural heritage sites, driving the continuous heating up of \"archaeology fever\" and \"museum fever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultural museums are \"breaking out of their circles\" and naturally attracting attention. \"High culture\" is no longer \"appreciated by few,\" and niche interests are becoming mainstream. The innovative dissemination of archaeological achievements and historical research results is attracting people to rediscover the brilliance of Chinese civilization, and cultural relics are truly \"coming alive.\"\n",

Since the beginning of this year, public security service windows in Lincang City, Yunnan Province have comprehensively entered county-level government service centers. The city's public security service windows have been consolidated and streamlined from the original 186 single-service windows to 138 comprehensive service windows. Full-time and part-time police officers and auxiliary police at the windows have been optimized from the original 476 to 380 people. Service items at government service centers have increased from the original 32 to 133 items, with public satisfaction rate for government services exceeding 98%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lincang City Public Security Bureau has vigorously promoted the entry of public security government service items into three-level government service centers, striving to achieve a transformation from \"single police unit with multiple windows\" to \"integrated one-window service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lincang City, \"six-in-one\" comprehensive public security windows covering petitions, traffic police, anti-drug, public security, cybersecurity, and entry-exit services have been established in county (district) government service centers; \"three-in-one\" comprehensive public security service windows covering petitions, traffic police, and public security have been opened at township and town convenience service centers. For townships that do not yet have conditions for entry, police stations have integrated with traffic police service windows to establish public security convenience service stations. Currently, comprehensive public security windows in all 8 counties (districts) have fully entered county-level government service centers, 32 police stations have entered township convenience service centers, and 8 police stations have integrated their service windows with traffic police squadrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, following the principle of \"general windows for quick processing, specialized windows for precise processing,\" they have established a \"general + specialized\" dual-track service model. At county-level public security government service windows, no less than 50% are comprehensive \"general\" windows that handle all services, with front desk comprehensive reception, back office classified approval, and comprehensive window document issuance. \"One window can now perform the functions of three or four previous windows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During summer vacation, the comprehensive public security service window at Lincang City Government Service Center experienced peak processing periods, handling an average of 150-200 cases on-site daily, reaching over 300 cases at peak times.\n",

      "\"To provide high-quality and efficient services to the public, we need to understand the operations of all police units and learn while working,\" said window officer Chen Pin.

      "\n",
      "Adhering to the goal of public satisfaction, Lincang City Public Security Bureau continues to strengthen responsibility awareness, regularly conducts business training, implements job rotation systems, and focuses on capability assurance. Meanwhile, window departments have improved and implemented systems such as first-inquiry responsibility, service commitment, time-limited completion, and incomplete application acceptance systems.

      "Yang Xianyi was an extremely rare talent in academic circles, and his two sisters were also extraordinary. His elder sister Yang Minru was an expert in Chinese classical literature, and his second sister Yang Jingru (who later changed her name to Yang Jiang) was also a famous translator. They came from a scholarly family. Their father Yang Yuzhang received traditional Chinese education in his early years, then studied in Japan, majoring in economics at Waseda University. After returning to China, he served as the first president of Bank of China in Tianjin. With his own abilities, he amassed a fortune of millions, with the only regret being that he had no male heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first wife was pregnant eight times, but only two survived, and both were girls. Yang Yuzhang then took a second wife. In 1915, the second wife gave birth to son Yang Xianyi. The birth of a son was great joy for the Yang family. Yang Xianyi was taken away after birth to live with the first wife, becoming the most beloved treasure of the household. Subsequently, the second wife gave birth to two more daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the son was 5 years old, Yang Yuzhang suddenly fell seriously ill and unfortunately died young, leaving behind substantial wealth as well as three women and six children (including a concubine and her daughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Yang Xianyi's mother was only 24 years old. She was determined to raise her three children well and give them a good education. She came from humble origins, being a child from a poor farming family in rural Hebei. Without money for schooling and knowing few characters, she was sold to the Yang family as a concubine. She was young and beautiful, naturally intelligent, and won Yang Yuzhang's sincere affection. Soon, she learned to read and write from her \"master\" (as she called her husband). The couple had deep feelings for each other and often read novels together. Through reading, she experienced joy she had never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the sweet days lasted only six or seven years before her husband suddenly left her, leaving her heartbroken. Only her three children were her greatest comfort. Since she had given birth to the family's only son, Yang Xianyi, she received tens of thousands of yuan worth of stocks as her inheritance. Life was relatively comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife was a wealthy young lady from a family of equal social standing to the Yangs. She had attended private school and her greatest hobby was playing mahjong. She had a gentle temperament and treated the two concubines and their daughters fairly well. However, she believed that \"ignorance is a virtue for women\" and never cared about her two daughters' education. Yang Xianyi's mother, having personally experienced the benefits of reading, fought for educational opportunities for her two daughters. As soon as they reached school age, they successively entered the American missionary school Zhongxi Girls' School, which was then the best girls' school in Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the only boy in this wealthy family and became the household's \"little emperor\" from birth. He lived a life of luxury and comfort. From a very young age, he showed himself to be both clever and mischievous. He once poured a bottle of French brandy that his father drank into the goldfish bowl, watching the \"drunk fish\" tumble about in the tank, which he found very amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife sincerely hoped this precious son would grow up smoothly and ranked him among the girls—she believed girls had \"cheap\" fates and were easier to raise. The first and second sisters were the first wife's two daughters, Yang Xianyi was ranked third, the concubine's daughter ranked fourth, and Yang Minru and Yang Jingru were ranked fifth and sixth respectively. Therefore, the children of his uncles would joke with Yang Xianyi, calling him \"Miss Yang the Third.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the \"apple of the eye\" of the entire family. His sister Yang Minru still remembered: \"His toys were different from ordinary people's. We still played with one toy even after we grew up—what is now called a music box. It made tinkling sounds inside, with several men and women dancing, all dressed in clothes from the era of French Louis XIV. That music box was so expensive. That was his plaything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young master turned 7, the first wife worried about him being kidnapped, so for safety, she hired a former Qing dynasty scholar, Mr. Wei Ruzhou, to teach at home. Yang Xianyi began reading the \"Three Character Classic\" and \"Hundred Family Surnames,\" followed by the Four Books and Five Classics, \"Ancient Prose Observations,\" Tang poetry and Song lyrics, establishing a solid foundation in Chinese classical studies. Although he wasn't diligent, he always earned praise from old Mr. Wei. During this period, he also read many miscellaneous books.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until Yang Xianyi was 13 that the first wife allowed him to attend the missionary school Xinxue Academy for middle school.\n",

      "\n",
      "At school, Yang Xianyi remained undiligent, spending more time playing. The student who always came first in the class was very hardworking, while Yang Xianyi said: \"I won't compete with him, so I always come second.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi often played pranks. Once during an algebra exam, some classmates couldn't solve certain problems. He wrote the answers on paper strips and passed them to others, even sticking one on the teacher's back. The teacher was proctoring, walking back and forth in the classroom, and everyone could see the answers... Later the teacher discovered this and had a talk with him. He confessed readily. Not only did the teacher not punish him, but praised him for being honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After old Mr. Wei left the Yang family due to advanced age and poor health, the mother hired another tutor to help Yang Xianyi and his two sisters with English and mathematics. Although the children's academic performance was already good, the mother's desire for her son to become a dragon and daughters to become phoenixes was urgent, so she still hired tutors, hoping the three siblings' grades could be even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sisters worshipped their brother completely and felt themselves \"stupid\" in comparison. Yang Minru said: \"When he could recite the Thirteen Classics fluently, I hadn't even mastered the Four Books and Five Classics yet. In middle school, he was already contemplating writing chapter-style novels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru said: \"My brother was too clever. At 7 he was writing classical poetry, and was quick at making couplets too. The teacher at that time was called 'Xu Jiansheng,' and as soon as my brother saw this, he immediately made a three-character response—'Kuai Qiangbi' (Quick Gun Death).\" (\"Xu\" pairs with \"Kuai,\" \"Jian\" pairs with \"Qiang,\" \"Sheng\" pairs with \"Bi\")\n",
      "\n",
      "That teacher whose name was paired by Yang Xianyi as \"Quick Gun Death\"—Xu Jiansheng—was not only not angry about this, but was actually very happy to encounter such a talented student. It was also this Teacher Xu who laid a solid English foundation for the three siblings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teacher Xu Jiansheng was from Guangdong, graduated from the English Literature Department of Sun Yat-sen University, and was married to surgeon Chi Shiqing. She got along very harmoniously with the Yang family. The children called her \"Teacher,\" and the mother called her \"Mrs. Chi.\" Later the mother even had the three children recognize her as their \"godmother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yang mansion was located on Garden Street in the Japanese concession of Tianjin. This was a large residence, and life was affluent and leisurely, with daily life taken care of by servants. Yang Xianyi and his siblings went to the cinema every week to watch movies, both Chinese and foreign. The mother was both strict and lenient with the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru was a premature baby and had always been in poor health. The doctor suggested the mother let the child breathe more fresh air in nature. In the summer of 1931, the mother took the three siblings and invited Teacher Xu Jiansheng to Beijing's Fragrant Hills to escape the heat. This was the Yang siblings' first time leaving Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "By coincidence, Yang Xianyi's cousin Yang Zuanwu and his classmate from Nankai Middle School, Luo Peilin, were also vacationing at Fragrant Hills. Luo Peilin came from a prominent Tianjin family and was a top student in the class. Having graduated from high school this year and taken college entrance exams, he was waiting for results. Several young people became playmates, running up and down the mountains, singing, playing chess, and playing cards in the villa... Luo Peilin got along very well with Yang Minru, and they left good impressions on each other. Everyone had a delightful time during this trip to Fragrant Hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, within a few years, two uncles had used up the father's inheritance. The Yang family had to sell the house on Garden Street. The eldest sister married, the second sister died, the concubine left with her daughter, and the extended family dispersed. The first wife, the mother, and Yang Xianyi's siblings moved to Zhaofeng Road in the French concession, living in a rented house. The extended family gradually consumed their remaining wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1934, Yang Xianyi graduated from middle school and was admitted to Yenching University. His grades were so excellent that the school let him skip a grade and start from sophomore year. At this time, one of his middle school English teachers was returning to Britain for vacation, and he wanted to follow the teacher to study at Oxford University in England. The first wife hoped he would stay to inherit the family property, but he insisted on leaving, and his mother also supported her son's overseas education.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Yang Minru was admitted to the Chinese Literature Department of Yenching University, studying under Gu Sui. In 1937, Yang Jingru graduated from middle school and was recommended to the Chinese Literature Department of Nankai University. The \"July 7th Incident\" occurred, and Nankai University was bombed. The following year, as a Nankai \"restoration student,\" she went to Southwest Associated University in Kunming.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Minru was studying at Yenching, she received a letter from Luo Peilin expressing his affection for her. By this time, he had graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. When Yang Minru returned to Tianjin during vacation and told her mother about this, her mother immediately found out that Luo Peilin's parents had already arranged an engagement for him and ordered her daughter absolutely not to associate with him. After graduating from university, Yang Minru studied as a graduate student under Professor Gu for a year and a half. During the 1939 winter vacation,\n",

      "\n",
      "Recently, \"Thirty Lectures on Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\" compiled and edited by the Central Publicity Department, has been publicly published and distributed. The book is divided into 30 topics, comprehensively, systematically, and deeply explaining the major significance, scientific system, rich connotations, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It serves as an important supplementary reading material for cadres and the masses to study and understand Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in depth. This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. Reading the chapters on comprehensive opening-up in this book, one cannot help but feel particularly proud of our Party's vision and magnanimity in promoting the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up, and feel genuinely proud of the ideological height, conceptual depth, and breadth of vision achieved by our Party's theoretical innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1978, China has become increasingly open. Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening-up, we opened our doors to build our country, successfully achieving the great transformation from closure and semi-closure to comprehensive opening-up. Facing the new journey ahead, we must promote high-quality development of China's economy under a more open state to continuously meet people's needs for a better life. Currently, the international situation is undergoing profound changes, and the world economy and global economic governance system have entered a period of adjustment. Protectionist undercurrents in Western developed countries are gradually surging, and Western countries that originally expanded outward with aggressive force are showing inward-looking tendencies; emerging markets and developing countries are showing trends of collective rise, with international forces displaying patterns of \"East rising, West declining\" and \"South rising, North declining.\" At a time when the world faces uncertainty, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the important strategic thinking of forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up. General Secretary Xi Jinping considers the requirements of the times for forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up from the strategic height of human social development and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Seizing opportunities to expand opening-up is not only a valuable experience of China's reform and development, but also the inevitable path for national prosperity and development. For contemporary China, opening-up is definitely not an accidental strategic choice, but an inevitable strategic decision for pursuing high-quality development. In fact, forming a higher-level opening-up pattern has become a key choice concerning contemporary China's destiny and whether it can realize the dream of national rejuvenation. Comprehensive opening-up is not optional, but an important treasure for our Party to lead the Chinese people in catching up with the times through great strides in international competition and realizing the great cause of Chinese national rejuvenation. Looking around the world, comprehensive opening-up has become a dynamic and fundamental symbol of China's rapid development and prosperity, and the most appealing and attractive symbolic sign of the Communist Party of China leading international relations in the new era. Comprehensive high-level opening-up is a distinctive feature of contemporary China and a distinctive characteristic of our Party's governance in the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the necessary driving force for accelerating the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Opening-up brings progress, while closure inevitably leads to backwardness. Human development is based on the improvement of productivity levels, which depend on technological invention and improvement, and technological invention and improvement depend on human knowledge innovation and the accumulation of experience. Diverse environments are more conducive to enhancing people's creative thinking, while exchanges and mutual learning between different civilizations are conducive to knowledge innovation and dissemination. Only through continuously expanding exchanges can human wisdom be stimulated and human knowledge and technology be more widely disseminated. The Chinese nation has had a glorious past, which was an era of exchanges and mutual learning with neighbors through magnificent bearing and broad-mindedness; we have also had dim years, which were the consequences of self-admiration through closing the country to foreign contact. Opening-up to the outside world is our country's basic national policy, and also an important treasure for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the continuous achievements of socialist modernization. We should expand the scope of opening-up and increase the intensity of opening-up to conduct mutual exchanges, mutual learning, and mutual borrowing with increasingly broad cultures, expanding the horizons of experience and thinking in mutual exchanges, accelerating the transfer of knowledge and skills in mutual learning, and encouraging the emergence of new knowledge and technologies in mutual borrowing. Ancient Chinese inventions once benefited the world, while many scientific and technological achievements from modern developed countries have also promoted China's development. The Chinese nation should have an increasingly broad mind on the road to great rejuvenation, so that we can stimulate our creative vitality and improve our competitiveness through the mutual interaction of different cultures and civilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary prerequisite for expanding the broad world stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only in the vast ocean can there be space for dragons to grow and develop; in streams, mud ponds, or shallow pools, giant whales cannot grow, only small fish and shrimp can survive. Marxism tells us that practice leads to true knowledge and hard work produces real results. However, the size of the stage for practice often determines the breadth of practice; the size of the stage for careers often determines the scale of careers. Times create heroes, and heroes need bigger stages. Struggle promotes national rejuvenation, and those who struggle also need larger spaces. By expanding opening-up, we create broader space and stages for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Human history has developed through opening-up, and human civilization has been disseminated and enriched through opening-up. China is an ancient civilized country, but it declined in modern times due to rulers' policies of closing the country to foreign contact. At that time, the world, due to the discovery of new continents, transformed from previously isolated existences into an increasingly interconnected world, creating a stage for the rise of the Western world. Today, our opening-up to the outside world is not a return to ancient Han and Tang strategies toward neighbors, but truly going global in the tide of economic globalization, providing a broader stage for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up can we better coordinate two markets (domestic and international), two types of resources (domestic and international), and two categories of rules (domestic and international). The new pattern of comprehensive opening-up involves not only material aspects but also human resources. We should seek intelligent minds globally for our use, coordinate two types of talent resources (domestic and international), stimulate more intellectual momentum, and assist in implementing the innovation-driven strategy. Today, realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation means returning to the center of the world stage. This stage has transcended the ancient \"all under heaven\" planar perspective and is a global world stage. Only by taking on greater responsibilities and playing a greater role on this global world stage can it be called realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the inevitable choice for leading the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China's reform and opening-up and peaceful development are events of world historical significance at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, considering that China has one-fifth of the world's population. China's development has not only enabled the Chinese nation to escape the state of poverty and backwardness since modern times, but has also brought opportunities for the development of the entire world due to its vast market with enormous potential. On this planet, the complex and increasingly close connections caused by economic globalization have created a situation of \"you in me, me in you,\" forming a pattern where all prosper together or all suffer together. However, some people are short-sighted, loudly proclaiming \"free trade\" when it benefits them, but beginning to build protectionist barriers when it is slightly disadvantageous to them. Facing this situation, China confidently adheres to expanding opening-up and strives to form a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up. To promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and achieve win-win sharing, we must expand the breadth and depth of opening-up. Our Belt and Road Initiative seeks to build new platforms for international cooperation through connectivity, add new momentum for common development, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. The Belt and Road originates from China but belongs to the world. The Belt and Road is an open platform that should transcend the boundaries of different regions, different civilizations, and different development stages. The Belt and Road is a path of win-win cooperation that should continuously extend and expand. As long as everyone clarifies the major goal of connectivity and win-win cooperation, strengthens policy coordination, aligns their respective development strategies, adheres to consultation, construction, and sharing, and strengthens policy communication, facility connectivity, trade flow, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds, relying on project-driven approaches and deepening practical cooperation, it will certainly promote the development and prosperity of all countries and benefit people worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the inevitable path for demonstrating the vitality of socialism through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Socialism became reality in the wave of international communist movements and can only develop and grow through the surging of international waves. By implementing reform and opening-up, we have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and ushered in bright prospects for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only through further comprehensive opening-up can we inject strong momentum into realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and enable scientific socialism to burst forth with strong vitality in China.

Currently, it's pomegranate harvesting and sales season, with merchants from various places gathering here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following trucks from all over the country, the reporter entered Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Co., Ltd., located in Baicao Village, Luchang Town, Huili City. On the sorting production line, plump and rosy pomegranates undergo fruit selection, weighing, and loading before being shipped to Southeast Asia and other destinations, beginning their international journey. \"Currently, our annual export volume is about 10,000 tons, with operating revenue of approximately 50 million yuan,\" said Zuo Ziwen, director of Huili City Wanqing Pomegranate Professional Cooperative.\n",

      "\n",
      "Zuo Ziwen is a native of Huili who has been growing pomegranates for over 30 years. He casually picked up a soft-seed pomegranate, peeled open the skin, and proudly told the reporter: \"Look how good our Huili pomegranates are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Good products also encounter sales difficulties. \"Previously, our good products couldn't sell for good prices. When market conditions were poor, a whole year's work would be in vain,\" Zuo Ziwen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason was that pomegranates came to market at concentrated times. When inventory accumulated and there was no way to extend shelf life, fruit farmers could only sell at low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain fruit freshness and extend preservation time, years ago, after extensive research, Zuo Ziwen began building refrigerated controlled atmosphere storage. Now, a modern pomegranate trading center and pomegranate auction market integrating pomegranate grading and sorting, online trading, information publishing, warehousing and processing, cold chain logistics, financial services, and big data analysis applications has been built in Baicao Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This agricultural product sorting facility covers 40,000 square meters, including 37 controlled atmosphere preservation storage rooms for agricultural product refrigerated warehousing, capable of storing 6,500 tons of agricultural products,\" Zuo Ziwen introduced. The operation of controlled atmosphere storage regulates peak and off-peak marketing seasons, allowing sales to create time differences. Pomegranates stored in controlled atmosphere storage maintain their brightness and freshness well, enhancing fruit market value and strengthening industrial advantages.\n",

      "Fresh fruits sold domestically and internationally\n",
      "Integrated production-supply-sales system helps increase income\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving storage and preservation problems means Huili pomegranates will travel further. However, issues like low efficiency and weak channels still constrain agricultural products' journey. To go further, the entire agricultural \"production-supply-sales\" chain needs to be connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Center in Baicao Village, a larger area is used for offline sorting, packaging, and e-commerce operations of agricultural products. Over 100 distributors from across the country have settled here, with the logistics center's cold storage, turnover boxes, steel shelves, fruit selection equipment, and forklifts all available for e-commerce use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On one hand, through cooperation between companies, cooperatives, and farmers, we provide technical guidance to farmers to ensure high-quality products enter the market; on the other hand, by collecting user information, we precisely formulate sales plans, establish fruit standards, achieve grade classification, and multi-channel sales,\" Zuo Ziwen introduced.\n",

Researchers have developed a \"follow the vine to find the melon\" technical approach of \"first finding strike-slip faults, then exploring oil and gas reservoirs.\" However, due to the deep burial of reservoir targets, artificial seismic reflection signals returning to the surface are weak and are affected by near-surface desert conditions and deep high-velocity igneous rock shielding, making signal \"decryption\" extremely difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, researchers established a series of three-dimensional seismic geological models of the Tarim Basin strike-slip fault system and ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs. Based on three-dimensional numerical simulation and physical simulation methods, they conducted research on seismic wave propagation mechanisms in ultra-deep complex fault-controlled reservoirs, summarizing the seismic wave propagation patterns and seismic response characteristics of fault-controlled reservoirs with different structural styles.

Full-azimuth angle domain imaging fully utilizes wide-azimuth seismic information, performing imaging in local angle domains underground, multi-dimensionally characterizing the contours and internal structures of fault-controlled reservoirs and dissolution fracture-cave bodies. Based on analytical wavefield reverse time migration imaging theory, they innovatively developed anisotropic reverse time migration imaging technology, effectively reducing the impact of fracture heterogeneity. They developed wide-frequency Q compensation reverse time migration imaging technology, effectively compensating for the attenuation effects of effective signals during ultra-long distance propagation.

This cost-performance ratio simply breaks all the rules, leaving competitors with no way out. They have cost advantages for things they can make themselves, and they also get the most favorable prices for things they procure. Even German PhDs supply BYD at the lowest prices, treating them as top-tier customers. Other domestic companies don't get this treatment. BYD has the confidence because they not only have capital, but more importantly, they have technology in hand. Technology can be exchanged for capital, and technology can also be exchanged for technology. Without technology, others set your prices; with technology that others need, you can negotiate. Because BYD uses their self-developed ESP to negotiate with Bosch, meaning \"if you don't give me the best price, I'll make it myself, and once production scales up, I might even sell to other automakers.\" Companies with technology should be this powerful.

      "In recent years, Tianmen City has vigorously developed the vegetable industry, with the city's vegetable planting area reaching 420,000 acres and total output of 1.2 million tons. Market-oriented and focusing on industry development shortcomings, it has made efforts in multiple areas to build a complete vegetable industry chain, leading industrial upgrading and promoting farmers' income growth. Following the development philosophy of \"buying nationwide, selling nationwide\" and highlighting the two core functions of \"consolidation\" and \"distribution,\" Tianmen is accelerating the construction of a vegetable distribution hub in Central China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Autumn in Duobao is green.\n",
      "Rows of thriving radish seedlings decorate the fields with vibrant life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duobao Town is the township with the largest vegetable planting area in Tianmen, with white radish covering 100,000 acres, generating output value exceeding 400 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the town's total agricultural output value.\n",
      "\n",
      "From \"carrying baskets for small sales\" that couldn't reach beyond Hubei, to \"dressed up for distant marriage\" flying nationwide, what transformation path has this radish town taken? On September 13, Hubei Daily all-media reporters visited Duobao Town for field investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From scattered to contiguous, the radish town takes initial shape\n",
      "\n",
      "Watering, thinning seedlings, fertilizing, weeding... During autumn planting season, at the vegetable planting base of Hubei Minghe Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. located in Dazhong New Village, Duobao Town, hundreds of workers bustle in the fields daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "This company is a leading enterprise in Tianmen's vegetable industry, with over 8,000 acres of self-cultivated vegetables and developing over 20,000 acres of contract farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, we wouldn't have dared imagine such scale,\" said Wu Hanping, the company's chairman. He began vegetable cultivation in 2012, when it was mainly manual planting with low mechanization levels, and 300 acres was already the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Duobao Town mainly grew cotton, wheat, soybeans, etc. Vegetables were only scattered household cultivation with low yields, poor appearance, and limited market access... Wu Hanping and other large-scale growers began frequently visiting Shandong, Hebei, Hunan and other places to learn, bringing back advanced vegetable cultivation concepts and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Previously, vegetable seedlings could only be bought from other regions at high prices of 1 yuan or even 1.5 yuan per plant, making costs high,\" Wu Hanping said. In 2017, the company decided to build its own seedling greenhouses. At that time, solar greenhouses were popular, but he insisted on building connected greenhouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar greenhouses can only be used for a few months in autumn and winter annually, while connected greenhouses can freely adjust temperature and humidity, achieving year-round seedling cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Minghe Company's connected greenhouse seedling facility, reporters saw modern equipment including wet curtain cooling, automatic irrigation, integrated water and fertilizer systems, heating and supplementary lighting - full of \"technology appeal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, with the rise of facility agriculture and progress in agricultural mechanization, Duobao's vegetable industry has rapidly expanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, planting radishes required manual seeding, with one person able to sow only 1 acre per day. Later, seeding machines became widely used, with one machine completing 100 acres daily. Now, except for weeding and harvesting, full mechanization has basically been achieved, with average yield reaching over 8,000 pounds per acre in normal years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganlu Village is a renowned vegetable village. Village Party Secretary Wen Yuanjun introduced that the village has over 3,000 acres of vegetable cultivation, radiating to over 10,000 acres in surrounding areas. Large-scale growers in the village commonly earn over one million yuan annually, while ordinary villagers can earn over 100,000 yuan yearly through land transfer fees and working in cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Duobao Town's vegetable planting area remains stable at around 120,000 acres, with varieties expanding to over 30 types including peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc., driving about 26,000 vegetable-growing households with average income increase of 12,000 yuan per household.\n",
      "\n",
      "From single to diverse, radishes also have \"different grades\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how good agricultural products are, they can only rot in the fields without smooth market channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early days, due to poor logistics and information flow, Duobao radish sales radius was limited to areas around Tianmen. Wu Hanping deeply felt this: \"For distant wholesale markets, when calling to inquire, the price was over 1 yuan per pound, but by the time we transported the radishes there, it had dropped to several cents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From initially sending people to squat at various markets to inquire about prices, to now browsing price lists of major markets nationwide online, both information and logistics bottlenecks have been resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, smooth information and logistics have turned the nation into one large market, making competition increasingly fierce. For radishes to travel far and sell well, stable quality comes first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minghe Company implements \"three reductions, three increases\" healthy cultivation technology for vegetables - reducing fertilizer, pesticide use, and labor while increasing yield, income, and efficiency - achieving 5% reduction each in fertilizer and pesticide use, over 13% reduction in labor per acre, and over 3% yield increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovation in sales concepts is equally important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Duobao radishes were still sold with soil, loaded directly from fields without classification, grading, or packaging. Purchasers needed to spend manpower, resources, and time for sorting and grading, resulting in costs far higher than other mature suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "With market consumer segmentation, agricultural products must be strictly graded for sale according to standards, creating price tiers to sell well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Duobao radishes are graded into four levels after harvest: premium, regular, small radishes, and substandard based on size, weight, and appearance. The price difference between premium and regular quality exceeds 3 cents per pound. \"Sorted premium radishes not only look good but are valuable, made into vegetable gift boxes and sold individually,\" Wu Hanping said. Currently, Duobao vegetables have successfully entered food supply chain platforms like Wangjiahuan, Qian Dama, and Duoduo Maicai, directly supplying dining tables of thousands of households nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, Minghe Company's vegetable sales reached 80 million yuan, with continued growth expected this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "From learning to exporting, Duobao farmers travel in groups to other provinces for \"business trips\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 15, trucks loaded with white radishes drove into Minghe Company, where workers who had prepared early conducted washing, sorting, and packaging in an orderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since radishes in town were just recently planted, how could they already be washing radishes here?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These were grown in Shaanxi,\" Wu Hanping revealed. Connected through selfless aid during the pandemic, last year Wu Hanping was invited to inspect Shaanxi, where local government repeatedly invited them to develop agricultural cultivation and help local farmers prosper. After repeated inspections and trials, they currently rent 400 acres in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi for vegetable cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to geographical differences, vegetables planted in Shaanxi can be sown in June-July with harvest timing perfectly staggered from Tianmen. Wu Hanping said, \"Over these years, we've built good reserves in cultivation technology and financial strength. Now trying to expand outward allows us to extend the cultivation chain and achieve differentiated competition.\" He added that they will continue expanding vegetable cultivation to more northern provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Hanping isn't alone in planting vegetables in other provinces. In Ganlu Village, five cooperatives have planted over 3,000 acres of vegetables in Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi and other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wen Yuanzu, head of Shunfa Vegetable Professional Cooperative, said that currently, contiguous planting scale in Duobao and surrounding areas has developed to a certain degree, with land transfer prices exceeding 1,000 yuan per acre, while places like Shaanxi have larger contiguous planting space and relatively lower land transfer prices, offering clear cost advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once, we went out to learn and catch up with advanced regions' cultivation technology,\" Wu Hanping said. \"Now choosing to go out, we can achieve technology export, expand the brand influence of 'Duobao Radish,' and continue to grow and strengthen the Duobao radish industry.\"\n",

      "Starting from shooter Yang Qian winning the first gold medal for the Chinese sports delegation at these Olympics, Chinese athletes maintained strong momentum for gold medals throughout the Olympic Games, with five years of arduous preparation transformed into competitive drive. The Secretary-General of the Chinese sports delegation said that Chinese athletes won gold medals in 14 events at the Tokyo Olympics, the most gold-medal events in the history of overseas Olympic participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six traditional strong events performed steadily. The shooting team set a new Olympic medal record with 4 golds, 1 silver, and 6 bronzes, while the gymnastics team collected 3 golds, 3 silvers, and 2 bronzes. These two teams, which underperformed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, staged successful comebacks. The weightlifting team, which won 7 golds and 1 silver, and the diving team, which won 7 golds and 5 silvers, both achieved their respective best historical performances. The table tennis team continued their glory with 4 golds and 3 silvers. The badminton team reached finals in all 5 events, ultimately winning 2 golds and 4 silvers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Significant progress in fundamental major events, with multiple breakthroughs. Women's shot put won the first Olympic field event gold, women's javelin won gold, and Chinese athletes reached the men's 100-meter final for the first time... Track and field athletes displayed confidence and achieved abundant results. In swimming, Chinese athletes performed excellently, with women's relay and men's short-distance events achieving breakthroughs, and the number of gold-medal winning athletes reaching a new high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potentially advantageous events showed accumulated progress with pleasing results. Three water sports - rowing, canoeing, and sailing/windsurfing - performed outstandingly, contributing 3 golds, 2 silvers, and 3 bronzes combined. Women's trampoline won gold again after 13 years, women's épée won its first individual gold medal, track cycling women's team sprint successfully defended its title, and the women's 3x3 basketball team won a valuable bronze medal... Behind these achievements lies a dual improvement in medal coverage and overall strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking 4 world records, creating 21 Olympic records, sweeping gold and silver in 10 events, successfully defending gold medals in 11 events... The rising numbers demonstrate the deep foundation of Chinese competitive sports. \"The number of athletes who won gold medals this time was 52, and the number of athletes who finished in the top 8 in various events was 158, both creating new highs in the history of Chinese sports delegation's overseas Olympic participation, indicating that the depth of talent in China's competitive sports is increasing,\" said the Secretary-General of the Chinese sports delegation.\n",

      "**Veterans and Newcomers Each Displaying Their Excellence**\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the 431 athletes in the Chinese sports delegation, nearly 70% were participating in the Olympics for the first time. This lineup combining veterans with newcomers withstood the test of major competition. The Tokyo Olympic Games witnessed both the persistence of veterans and the growth of newcomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "32-year-old Gong Lijiao threw with all her might, fulfilling her Olympic dream after four attempts; 32-year-old Su Bingtian continuously broke through, significantly improving the Asian men's 100-meter record; 37-year-old Lü Xiaojun demonstrated tremendous strength, creating a new legend for veteran athletes; 32-year-old Ma Long was in excellent form, achieving the first \"double Grand Slam\" for male table tennis players... The emotions they brought to people cannot be measured by gold medals alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Olympic stories of veterans may have different endings, but in their unwavering struggle, they passed their strength to those who came after. The younger generation took up the baton, from Quan Hongchan with her perfect triple jumps, to Li Wenwen who lifted weights effortlessly, to Zhang Changhong who never missed a shot - these \"post-2000\" athletes dared to perform at crucial moments, displaying superb competitive levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cameras captured unforgettable scenes: in the women's 4×200m freestyle relay final, Chinese swimmers were overtaken twice and caught up twice; despite trailing by 11 kilograms in total weight, Chen Lijun fought with all his might to achieve a comeback; the Chinese women's rugby team made their Olympic debut, fighting bravely to reach the quarterfinals... The fighting spirit displayed by Chinese athletes was deeply moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youthful demeanor shown by Chinese athletes both on and off the field was refreshing. Creative heart gestures at award ceremonies, affectionate embraces with opponents... Through social media, people saw the confident, open, and composed side of Chinese athletes.\n",

      "**New Preparation Phase About to Begin**\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to previous editions, the competitive landscape of the Tokyo Olympics did not change significantly. A total of 65 delegations won gold medals and 93 delegations won medals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results achieved by Chinese athletes at the Tokyo Olympics met expectations, but some shortcomings and weak areas still exist. Affected by the Tokyo Olympics postponement, the Paris Olympics preparation cycle has shortened to 3 years, making time urgent. According to reports, the new cycle of preparation will continue to maintain positive and effective practices and measures from the Tokyo Olympics cycle, while also adopting some new targeted methods and approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although most Tokyo Olympics competitions were held without spectators, the performance of Chinese athletes received high attention from domestic sports fans, who supported and cheered for the athletes in various ways. The interaction between the venue and outside became a beautiful sight during the Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tokyo Olympics has concluded, and new Olympic preparation is about to begin. We look forward to Chinese athletes continuously achieving good results in their new Olympic journey!\n",

      "On May 26, China National Gold Group Corporation's subsidiary Laizhou Huijin Mining Investment Co., Ltd.'s Shaling Gold Mine created new history—the project's main shaft excavation and lining project reached completion at 1,551.8 meters depth, setting a new Asian record for the deepest single-phase excavation and lining of a vertical shaft. The Shaling builders used wisdom and sweat to cultivate fruitful results, continuing to write the legend of China National Gold Group's ultra-deep shaft construction, welcoming the victorious convening of the Party's 20th Congress with excellent achievements.\n",

      "Looking back at the construction process of the Shaling project's main shaft engineering, as a supporting demonstration project for the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" key R&D program \"Deep Earth Resources Exploration and Mining\" scientific research project, the main shaft engineering traversed the Jiaojia main fault plane with complex geological conditions. Problems such as high temperature, high hoisting capacity, high ground stress, high osmotic pressure, large water inflow, and strong corrosion followed one after another, covering almost all types of difficulties faced by domestic ultra-deep shafts, making construction extremely difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing the rare adverse construction conditions in China, all participating construction personnel fully demonstrated the work style of \"act immediately, work earnestly and pragmatically.\" Since construction began in May 2019, without waiting or relying on others, they forged ahead courageously, established \"joint party groups\" to focus on tackling key construction difficulties, pooled wisdom and efforts, and successively overcame eight major construction challenges including deep shaft construction efficiency, blasting efficiency optimization, grouting for water control, and equipment operation. They invited experts from top domestic scientific research institutes to diagnose on-site, continuously discussed treatment plans, and formed a series of deep construction operation specifications represented by wall-back grouting under complex geological conditions in deep areas, successfully filling many technical gaps in the field of domestic ultra-deep shaft construction. They continuously consolidated \"three basics\" construction, effectively leveraged the safety management advantage of \"everyone is a safety officer,\" adhered to the principle of being responsible and fulfilling responsibilities for safe production, and polished the \"safety foundation\" of the project's high-quality development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who act often succeed, and those who walk often arrive. Through three years of struggle, the project builders forged a construction path of never giving up and daring to innovate. Entrusted with the gold industry as a \"matter of national importance,\" battling a thousand meters underground, they finally achieved Asia's deepest shaft.\n",

Looking at the vast rainforest before him, Hong Xiaojiang, who witnessed the complete withdrawal of industrial and mining enterprises, often reflects: \"This 'treasure house' is now truly under strict protection!\"\n",

      "Hainan's tropical rainforest contains rich tropical biodiversity and genetic resources. In the past, due to economic development needs, local areas once exploited natural resources in a disorderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the \"Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park System Pilot Plan\" was issued, clearly requiring that industrial and mining enterprises within the national park that do not meet protection and planning requirements be gradually shut down and relocated, establishing a withdrawal mechanism for existing mining rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does the national park have to do with us?\" \"Why remove perfectly good 'money trees'?\"... Hong Xiaojiang, then head of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Administration office, still remembers the endless complaints and opposition voices at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, staff members patiently persuaded, held face-to-face discussions with enterprises, and coordinated at mining sites, finally convincing the \"tough\" enterprises to agree. By December 2021, all 10 mining rights within Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park had been completely abolished and withdrawn, bringing long-lost tranquility to the rainforest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, withdrawn mining companies have basically completed ecological restoration of mining areas, and mountains once riddled with pits and holes are again clothed in new green.

Deep in Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, Feng Limin, conducting autumn research, is attracted by a set of footprints and rushes forward. \"These are wild Siberian tiger tracks, an adult female with two cubs!\" he says excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feng Limin is Deputy Director of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard Monitoring and Research Center under the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. According to him, for a long period in the past, due to increased human activity, wild Siberian tiger habitat disappeared and degraded, causing rapid population decline. In 1998, only 12 to 16 wild Siberian tigers remained in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, the country successively adopted measures including establishing nature reserves, stopping commercial logging of natural forests, and clearing mountains and traps, achieving some results, but challenges remained: protection work involved multiple departments and administrative regions, ecosystems were fragmented by administrative divisions, and the fragmentation of Northeast tiger and leopard protected areas was serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park pilot work was launched, spanning Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, with administrative functions from 7 departments including land and forestry transferred to the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park Administration. Forest vegetation restoration, core area production and living withdrawal, and tiger-leopard migration corridor construction continued... all measures were designed to let tigers once again \"rule\" the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, through the \"integrated sky-earth monitoring system,\" the movements of Northeast tigers and leopards can be observed in real time. Latest monitoring data shows that approximately 70 wild Siberian tigers and about 80 wild Amur leopards now live stably within the park, with activity ranges exceeding 11,000 square kilometers, about 80% of the entire park area.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once, due to natural and human factors, China's giant panda population was fragmented into multiple small populations, living as if on isolated \"islands,\" hindering their reproduction and survival. By the end of 2013, the national wild giant panda population was 1,864 individuals, divided into 33 local populations, with 24 populations facing extinction risk due to small panda numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, Giant Panda National Park was officially established. To enhance giant pandas' genetic exchange capabilities, the Sichuan section, including the Yingjing area, planned 10 giant panda ecological corridors including Tuowu Mountain, Niba Mountain, and Erlang Mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Sichuan section focuses on important giant panda habitats and key ecological corridors, implementing ecological restoration across nearly 54 square kilometers, effectively protecting 64.8% of the nation's wild giant pandas,\" says Chen Zongqian, Deputy Director of Sichuan Provincial Forestry and Grassland Administration.\n",

On the evening of May 15, Lei Jun, founder of Xiaomi Corporation (1810.HK), delivered an internal speech, reviewing the impact of the Xiaomi automotive accident, the social responsibilities that Xiaomi Corporation needs to bear as a large company, and disclosing the progress of Xiaomi's smartphone SoC chip Xuanjie O1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some voices are full of expectations for Xiaomi's re-disclosure of the SoC chip, while others question the depth of Lei Jun's reflection. Within nearly a year, Xiaomi Corporation's stock price rose from a low of HK$15.36 to a high of HK$59.45, and has continued to fluctuate recently due to automotive business issues. Based on Xiaomi Corporation's own diversified business support and the brand image shaped by Lei Jun, the secondary market has not yet seen large-scale excessive panic selling. As of press time, Xiaomi Corporation's stock price was HK$51.05, up 1.79%.\n",

      "Trying to handle everything at once will lead to failure in the most important matters. Lei Jun once stated that while investing half his energy in the automotive business, he invests about one-third of his energy focusing on the smartphone business, as smartphones are Xiaomi's foundation for survival. But when both smartphones and automobiles face red ocean competition, the allocation of the leader's energy is particularly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fifteen years since Xiaomi's founding, whether it was the initial \"Eight King Kongs,\" the external executive team introduced later, or the young talent pipeline cultivated internally, Lei Jun, as a branded symbol of the group, has played a decisive role in all of them. To some extent, the Xiaomi brand has become directly synonymous with Lei Jun personally, but when the competitive situation of projects incubated within the group becomes increasingly severe, Lei Jun, who claims to have \"bet his entire fortune,\" also needs to seriously consider that perhaps not every success needs to be achieved by \"me.\"\n",

      "The \"Unexpected\" Blow\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of February 29, an accident that occurred on the Deshanggao Expressway in Anhui pulled Xiaomi Automotive, which had been conducting high-profile marketing for months, into a cooling-off period. The official investigation results of the traffic accident have not yet been released, and Xiaomi Automotive has once again encountered controversy over false advertising regarding the carbon fiber front hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, one of the core selling points of the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra was the carbon fiber dual-channel front hood priced at 42,000 yuan. Official marketing gave it halos such as \"replicating the aerodynamic design of the Nürburgring prototype car,\" \"enhancing downforce,\" and \"optimizing heat dissipation.\" However, according to actual testing by the car owner community after delivery, the wind channel openings could not blow tissue paper, and after disassembly, the internal structure was no different from ordinary aluminum hoods, not connected to the brake cooling system, nor producing the advertised downforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing problems of reduced functionality and inconsistent advertising, some car owners initiated collective rights protection, demanding vehicle returns and compensation. On May 7, Xiaomi Automotive officially issued an apology statement, acknowledging \"unclear information expression\" and proposing a compensation plan: undelivered orders could be changed to aluminum front hoods for free, and delivered users would receive 20,000 points (equivalent to about 2,000 yuan).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this plan was not accepted by the car owner community—changing configurations required re-queuing for more than 30 weeks, the points compensation was only 4.7% of the optional equipment fee, and did not cover the demand for vehicle returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Xiang, Director of the Vodafone Digital Automotive International Cooperation Research Center, told Yicai that currently some automakers, to achieve promotional effects, begin advertising vehicle functions before the vehicles are actually produced and rolled off the production line, and the customer orders they accept are all blind orders for automobiles. However, such automobiles have many uncertainties during the research and development production process.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of social events also caused Lei Jun to slow down his marketing activities on social media. In his review speech on the 15th, Lei Jun stated: At the end of March, a sudden traffic accident shattered everything. The company was subjected to storm-like questioning, criticism, and accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one expected that the impact of this accident would be so great, and the blow to Xiaomi would be so significant.\" Lei Jun said that the public's expectations and requirements for Xiaomi far exceeded imagination. Xiaomi's current scale, influence, and social attention have reached very high levels. Society and the public require Xiaomi to assume the responsibilities of a truly large company industry leader, which is an unavoidable responsibility for Xiaomi.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Safety Measures to Technology Investment\n",
      "\n",
      "After the automotive accident, Lei Jun said he held countless meetings with the group's management and automotive department colleagues, thinking about how to systematically solve problems and how to come up with more convincing business and governance performance to respond to the public's higher requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lei Jun did not explicitly state specific solutions and countermeasures, but he summarized them as \"technology-based.\" He said that Xiaomi proposed five years ago to invest more than 100 billion yuan in R&D costs over five years, with an expected investment of more than 30 billion yuan this year. At the same time, Lei Jun disclosed that Xiaomi's self-developed smartphone SoC chip Xuanjie O1 will be released at the end of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 16th, Lei Jun further spoke to sort out Xiaomi's chip-making history, saying that Xiaomi's chip research and development began in September 2014, and Xiaomi held its first chip launch conference in February 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Xiaomi established Pinecone Electronics, starting the path of self-developed chips. After 28 months, it completed the entire process from project initiation, tape-out to mass production of Surge S1, launching Surge S1 to the public in 2017. Although based only on 28nm process technology, Xiaomi's Surge S1 still made Xiaomi the fourth smartphone manufacturer after Apple, Samsung, and Huawei to independently develop chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, after S1, S2 did not arrive as scheduled, and the entire information disclosure activity for Xiaomi's self-developed SoC chips has been stagnant until now. In March 2023, Xiaomi released the MIX FOLD foldable phone, using the self-developed ISP (Image Signal Processor) chip \"Surge C1\" for the first time. The ISP is separated from the SoC and independent on the motherboard. Lei Jun said at the time that this was just a small step in Xiaomi's continuous exploration of professional imaging. Seven years had passed since Xiaomi's first chip was launched, but Xiaomi's chip-making journey had never stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Lei Jun emphasized the significance of chip-making for Xiaomi: Many people think that making chips is a matter of life and death, but Xiaomi still insists on doing it. In his view, chips are the commanding heights of smartphone technology, and Xiaomi must master core technologies. If Xiaomi wants to reach the top of the smartphone market, it must make long-term investments in chip technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smartphones Defend the Territory, Automobiles Venture into Dangerous Waters\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's investment in self-developed chips or automotive safety, Xiaomi Corporation currently faces multiple pressures. Lei Jun wears multiple hats and also faces dual challenges from the red ocean of smartphone business and the early stage of automotive business. Planning deployment priorities and balancing personal energy and group resource allocation is Lei Jun's urgent priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, in the smartphone market, according to Canalys data, driven by both national subsidies and overall consumption recovery, the mainland China smartphone market recovered moderately, with first-quarter 2025 shipments increasing by 5% year-on-year to 70.9 million units. Among them, Xiaomi's shipments reached 13.3 million units, a 40% year-on-year increase. Benefiting from product and channel synergies, Xiaomi returned to first place in the mainland China smartphone market with a 19% market share, maintaining the unchanged domestic target of at least 1% annual market share increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in international markets, excluding Chinese market shipments, Xiaomi's overseas smartphone shipments declined by approximately 8.7% year-on-year. Canalys Chief Analyst Zhu Jiatao stated: \"Regional smartphone conditions are becoming complex. Regions that showed strong growth momentum in the past year, such as India, Latin America, and the Middle East, have shown significant declines, revealing saturation in replacement demand for mass-market products. Most Android brands are actively adjusting their inventory levels in the first quarter to avoid affecting new product launches and channel pricing systems. The European market has declined again after a brief recovery, with manufacturers trapped by high flagship phone inventory at the end of last year and disruption to future mid-to-low-end product lines by ecological design regulations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the domestic new energy vehicle market, although relevant departments have proposed to further strengthen market supervision and rectify illegal marketing chaos, hand-to-hand combat has not ended, and price wars continue. According to insurance data provided by Li Yanwei, an expert from the China Automobile Dealers Association, Xiaomi Automotive sales have declined for three consecutive weeks. Although Wang Hua, General Manager of Xiaomi Corporation's Public Relations Department, stated that cyclical factors should be considered when addressing recent Xiaomi Automotive sales trends, both smartphones and automobiles are at critical stages where victory cannot be determined by one person's efforts alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lei Jun, since Xiaomi officially announced its automotive business, his focus and energy have gradually shifted from smartphones to automobiles. But as Lei Jun said in his 2024 annual speech: Xiaomi SU7 only means that Xiaomi Automotive has finally squeezed onto the table, but is still far from real success. Xiaomi Automotive's \"Long March\" has just begun.\n",

      "China Economic Herald News Reporter Jing Wenna reports: Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission has intensively carried out work to ensure supply and stabilize prices of important consumer goods, organizing experts and industry associations to conduct in-depth analysis of supply and demand conditions for various categories including grain, oil, meat, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables in 2024, particularly during the Spring Festival period; strengthening dynamic monitoring and situation assessment of market prices for key varieties in various regions; and convening meetings with relevant departments to specifically study supply guarantee and price stabilization work during the Spring Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission has deployed efforts across all regions to fully ensure market supply and stable price operation during the Spring Festival, creating a favorable price environment for people to celebrate the festival. First, strengthening supply source organization by requiring all regions to carefully assess trends in population flow, logistics, and weather changes during holidays, and conduct consumer demand analysis; fully leveraging the role of key enterprises such as agricultural product wholesale markets and large supermarkets to ensure good production-marketing connections and prepare adequate supply sources in advance; regions that may be affected by rain and snow weather should further increase stockpiling efforts to fully ensure smooth logistics. Second, conducting reserve releases and fair-price sales by releasing reserves of small-package grain and oil, pork, vegetables, etc. when necessary based on market conditions; implementing fair-price sales of important consumer goods according to local conditions to guide prices to remain at reasonable levels. Third, ensuring terminal supply by requiring key supermarkets to promptly stock shelves according to demand changes; reasonably allocating delivery personnel to ensure smooth \"last mile\" delivery. Fourth, strengthening market supervision by intensifying market and price supervision and inspection, guiding relevant entities to operate in compliance with laws and regulations; severely cracking down on illegal price violations according to law to ensure stable market operation.\n",

      "A strong nation must first have strong agriculture; only when agriculture is strong can the nation be strong. Recently, the \"Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Learning and Applying the Experience of the 'Thousand Village Demonstration and Ten Thousand Village Improvement' Project to Effectively and Vigorously Promote Comprehensive Rural Revitalization\" was released. This is the 12th Central Document No. 1 guiding \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work since the 18th CPC National Congress, once again sending a strong signal of prioritizing and strengthening agriculture, and pointing out the direction and practical path for promoting comprehensive rural revitalization and accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agriculture is the foundation of the world.\" Over the past year, facing complex domestic and international situations, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we overcame multiple adverse impacts including severe natural disasters, achieved \"twenty consecutive bumper harvests\" in grain production with output reaching new historical highs, saw rapid growth in farmers' incomes, and maintained harmonious and stable rural society, providing strong support for promoting economic recovery and improvement, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, and focusing on high-quality development. In comprehensively building a modern socialist country, the most arduous and onerous tasks still lie in rural areas. To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must persistently consolidate the agricultural foundation and promote comprehensive rural revitalization. In carrying out \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work in the new era and new journey, we should take promoting comprehensive rural revitalization as the general focus, adhere to people-centered development thinking, comprehensively, accurately, and fully implement the new development concept, fight a beautiful battle for comprehensive rural revitalization, create a new picture of livable, workable, and beautiful villages, and better promote Chinese-style modernization construction by accelerating agricultural and rural modernization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we must be guided by learning and applying the experience of the \"Thousand Villages Project.\" When General Secretary Xi Jinping worked in Zhejiang, he personally planned and promoted the \"Thousand Village Demonstration and Ten Thousand Village Improvement\" project. After more than 20 years of continuous efforts, this not only profoundly changed the overall appearance of Zhejiang's rural areas but also provided pioneering exploration and demonstration guidance for promoting comprehensive rural revitalization, offering lessons that all regions can learn from and draw upon. We should learn and apply the development concepts, working methods, and promotion mechanisms embodied in the \"Thousand Villages Project,\" starting from practical problems strongly reflected by farmers and the masses, identify entry points for rural revitalization, act according to local conditions with practical results, and concentrate efforts on accomplishing a batch of practical matters that the masses can feel and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we must firmly hold the two bottom lines of ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale return to poverty. Having grain in hand brings peace of mind. To ensure national food security, we must persist in the dual approach of stabilizing area and increasing yield per unit, effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers for grain production and localities for grain work, earnestly focus on grain and important agricultural product production, solidly advance the new round of action to increase grain production capacity by 100 billion jin, improve the \"trinity\" protection system for cultivated land quantity, quality, and ecology, ensure grain output remains above 1.3 trillion jin, build a diversified food supply system, and further secure China's rice bowl. We must implement the monitoring and assistance mechanism for preventing return to poverty, tighten responsibilities for preventing return to poverty, continue to strengthen industrial and employment assistance, increase support for key regions, improve development conditions, enhance \"blood-making\" capacity, stimulate endogenous motivation, continuously consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, and ensure no large-scale return to poverty occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, we must focus on improving rural industry development, rural construction, and rural governance levels as key work areas for sustained efforts. Rural areas are not only spatial carriers for agricultural production but also the homeland where vast numbers of farmers are born and raised. We must improve rural industry development levels, promote integrated development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, develop local specialties, persist in industry-led agriculture, quality-focused agriculture, and green agriculture, and accelerate the construction of a modern rural industry system that combines agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, integrates production, processing, and sales, and fuses agriculture, culture, and tourism. We must improve rural construction levels, enhance the effectiveness of rural planning guidance, adapt to trends in rural population changes, optimize village layout, industrial structure, and public service allocation, and coordinate new urbanization with comprehensive rural revitalization. We must improve rural governance levels, promote Party building to advance rural revitalization, develop rural culture, continue to promote rural customs reform, uphold and develop the \"Fengqiao Experience\" in the new era, and build peaceful villages. By coordinating rural industry development, rural construction, and rural governance and continuously creating a good environment for living and working in peace and contentment, we can give farmers a fuller sense of gain, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote comprehensive rural revitalization, technology is a powerful tool and reform is a magic weapon. We must strengthen the dual-wheel drive of technology and reform, optimize the strategic layout of agricultural technological innovation, increase efforts in tackling key core technologies in germplasm resources, strengthen rural reform and innovation, enhance the integrated effectiveness of reform measures, and add momentum and vitality to comprehensive rural revitalization. \"The world is well-governed when the people are prosperous.\" Increasing farmers' incomes is the central task of \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work. We must implement actions to promote farmers' income increase, continuously strengthen village industries that enrich the people, reinforce industry development to connect with and benefit farmers, strengthen vocational skills training for migrant workers, promote multi-channel employment for rural labor, broaden income-increasing channels, and make farmers' wallets fuller and their lives better.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China and is a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the \"14th Five-Year Plan.\" Doing well in \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work carries glorious missions and heavy responsibilities. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, let us anchor the goal of building a strong agricultural nation, maintain confidence, muster energy, and work hard and practically, implement the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements for \"agriculture, rural areas, and farmers\" work with the spirit of hammering nails, continuously achieve new results in promoting comprehensive rural revitalization, and make solid progress toward the goal of building a strong agricultural nation.\n",

China will continue to provide the world with high-quality Chinese manufacturing and stable Chinese supply. Second, jointly build smooth and efficient industrial and supply chains. Further strengthen global connectivity and make factors circulate more conveniently and be allocated more effectively. China will continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and strengthen innovative cooperation in smart manufacturing, digital economy and other fields. Third, jointly build open and inclusive industrial and supply chains. Clearly oppose protectionism and various forms of \"decoupling and chain-breaking,\" while working to promote green and low-carbon transformation of industrial and supply chains. China will integrate more deeply into the global industrial and supply chain system and actively participate in international cooperation in green development. Fourth, jointly build mutually beneficial and win-win industrial and supply chains. Promote the construction of a global industrial and supply chain system with broad participation from all countries, complementary advantages, and shared dividends. China will actively advance industrial and capacity cooperation with various countries and drive developing countries to participate more deeply in global value chains. We hope that entrepreneurs from all countries will play a positive role in promoting the steady operation of global industrial and supply chains. China will provide more convenience and better guarantees for enterprises from all countries to invest and develop business in China.\n",

      "It is worth noting that in November 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially issued the \"14th Five-Year Plan for Information and Communication Industry Development,\" which clearly proposed that during the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" period, it is necessary to enhance IPv6 end-to-end connectivity capabilities, improve IPv6 network performance and service levels, and achieve dual growth in IPv6 user scale and business traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Industry Collaboration Achieves Significant Results in IPv6 Traffic Enhancement**\n",
      "\n",
      "The release of the \"Three-Year Action Plan\" has inspired confidence and enthusiasm in the industry to accelerate the promotion of IPv6 \"traffic enhancement.\" Under strong policy guidance, basic telecommunications enterprises, internet companies, CDN vendors, and terminal manufacturers have vigorously promoted IPv6 upgrade and transformation work for networks, services, and terminals, with large-scale deployment results becoming increasingly evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since July 2021, the four major basic telecommunications enterprises - China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Broadcasting Network - have further accelerated infrastructure transformation. Based on the comprehensive completion of IPv6 upgrade and transformation for 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband networks, they have continuously promoted the upgrade and transformation of data centers, CDNs, and cloud networks, and combined with the implementation of \"dual gigabit\" services, accelerated the replacement of old broadband terminals to help enhance IPv6 traffic scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, internet companies and CDN enterprises such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and ChinaCache have continuously promoted the transformation of cloud, IDC, CDN, and other infrastructure, increasing support for IPv6 in related services. Companies like ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Meituan, Qihoo 360, and NetEase have continuously carried out APP transformations to improve APP IPv6 concentration. Terminal manufacturers such as Xiaomi, H3C, and Tenda have increased IPv6 transformation efforts for products on sale and under development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the joint efforts of the industry, China's IPv6 \"traffic enhancement\" has achieved significant results. At the \"2021 China IPv6 Innovation and Development Conference\" held on October 11, 2021, Han Xia, Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, announced to the industry that China's mobile network IPv6 traffic grew from zero to 22.87%, exceeding the annual target ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest data shows that by the end of 2021, China's mobile network IPv6 traffic proportion increased from 17.21% at the end of 2020 to 35.15%, and fixed network IPv6 traffic proportion increased from 4.3% at the end of 2020 to 9.38%, both achieving year-on-year doubling growth and exceeding predetermined targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Integration and Empowerment: \"IPv6+\" Innovation System Initially Formed**\n",
      "\n",
      "While IPv6 large-scale deployment was accelerating, IPv6 innovation also ran at \"accelerated speed.\" The \"Three-Year Action Plan\" clearly required gradually and orderly promoting \"IPv6+\" network and technology innovation. The \"14th Five-Year Plan for Information and Communication Industry Development\" also clearly pointed out support for carrying out \"IPv6+\" innovative technology pilots and large-scale applications in key industries such as finance, energy, transportation, education, and government affairs, enhancing IPv6 network's support capability for industrial digital transformation and upgrading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the entire industry accelerated the construction of the \"IPv6+\" innovation system, with a series of results landing nationwide. At the \"IPv6+\" Innovation City Summit Forum held on September 10, the \"IPv6+\" Innovation City was established in Shanghai. By 2025, Shanghai will build a new generation of information infrastructure system characterized by high speed, mobility, ubiquity, and intelligence. At the \"6th IPv6+ Industry Forum\" held on September 27, SAIC Motor and China Telecom jointly released the \"IPv6+ Industrial Intelligent Cloud Network Technology White Paper.\" In October, Wuhan took the lead nationwide in launching large-scale IPv6 deployment, accelerating the creation of an \"IPv6+\" digital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accelerate the integration of IPv6 into various industries, in October 2021, the first \"Guanghua Cup\" Gigabit Optical Network Application Innovation Competition, guided by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, was officially launched, with the competition setting \"IPv6+\" technology innovation applications as a separate track. In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other departments launched IPv6 technology and innovation integration application pilot work to accelerate IPv6 application empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, \"IPv6+\" has accelerated its implementation in finance, education, healthcare, energy, and other industries, driving digital transformation across various sectors. For example, Guangdong Province actively explored \"IPv6+\" applications in government external networks, establishing a provincial-level full-scenario \"IPv6+\" government external network benchmark. State Grid Jibei Electric Power Company took the lead in deploying \"IPv6+\" innovative technology in its network, significantly improving network autonomous decision-making capabilities and intelligence levels. China Construction Bank's more than 90 internet systems and Core Network 2.0 systems have completed IPv6 transformation and been put into production, innovatively using \"IPv6+\" technology to significantly enhance network delivery capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an indispensable \"network foundation\" for the digital economy era, large-scale IPv6 deployment is of great significance. Currently, China's IPv6 user and network scale ranks among the world's leaders, and IPv6 traffic and business carrying capacity have also been significantly enhanced. With the full launch of the \"traffic enhancement\" era, China's IPv6 development will further accelerate, strongly supporting digital transformation across thousands of industries and injecting strong momentum into building a cyber power and strengthening the digital economy.\n",

State Council Issues Another Capital Market Guidance Document - Strengthening Supervision, Preventing Risks, and Promoting High-Quality Development of Capital Markets - Exclusive Interview with CSRC Party Secretary and Chairman Wu Qing on Implementing the Third \"Nine Articles\" for Capital Markets**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the State Council issued \"Several Opinions on Strengthening Supervision, Preventing Risks and Promoting High-Quality Development of Capital Markets.\" This opinion consists of 9 parts and is the third \"Nine Articles\" for capital markets. Wu Qing, Party Secretary and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), gave an exclusive interview on December 12 regarding the implementation of this opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**After Another 10 Years, State Council Issues Capital Market Guidance Document Again**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How should we understand the important significance of issuing this opinion?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** This opinion issued by the State Council thoroughly implements General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions on capital markets and fulfills the deployment of the Central Financial Work Conference. Following the two \"Nine Articles\" of 2004 and 2014, this is another capital market guidance document issued by the State Council after another 10 years, fully demonstrating the high attention and earnest expectations of the Party Central Committee and State Council for capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the previous two \"Nine Articles,\" this opinion has the following main characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it fully embodies the political and people-centered nature of capital markets. It emphasizes adhering to and strengthening the Party's comprehensive leadership over capital market work, persisting in people-centered value orientation, and more effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors, especially small and medium investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it fully embodies the main theme of strong supervision, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development. We must maintain stability as the foundation, strengthen the fundamentals, strictly supervise and manage, and better serve the overall situation of high-quality economic and social development through the high-quality development of capital markets themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it fully embodies goal orientation and problem orientation. Particularly addressing prominent issues in institutional mechanisms and regulatory enforcement exposed by stock market volatility since August last year, it promptly addresses shortcomings and strengthens weak areas, responds to investor concerns, promotes resolution of deep-seated contradictions accumulated in capital markets over time, and accelerates the construction of secure, standardized, transparent, open, vibrant, and resilient capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Capital Market Development Goals Set in Opinion Are Progressive**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How should we understand the capital market development goals proposed in the opinion for the coming period?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The 20th Party Congress clearly proposed comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization. The Central Financial Work Conference set the goal of accelerating the construction of a financial powerhouse. A strong capital market is standard equipment for a modern economy. Promoting high-quality development of capital markets is conducive to promoting high-level circulation of technology, industry and capital, improving the modern industrial system, and driving the development of new quality productive forces; it is conducive to enriching financial products and services and creating more opportunities to increase residents' property income; it is also conducive to developing equity financing, optimizing financing structure, and improving the modern financial system with Chinese characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"Nine Articles\" focus on Chinese-style modernization as the center, anchor the goal of building a financial powerhouse, and propose capital market development goals for the next 5 years, 2035, and mid-century in phases, outlining a development blueprint from aspects including investor protection, listed company quality, industry institution development, regulatory capacity and governance system construction. We understand that this series of development goals is systematic and comprehensive, as well as progressive. We must persist in the market-oriented and rule-of-law reform direction, respect laws and rules, implement step by step, work persistently, and firmly transform the blueprint into reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Opinion Implementation Will Form \"1+N\" Policy System**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How will the CSRC systematically advance implementation of the various policy measures proposed in the opinion?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The new \"Nine Articles\" adheres to systematic thinking, combines near and far-term considerations, and implements comprehensive measures. Together with implementation arrangements organized by the CSRC and relevant parties, they form a \"1+N\" policy system. \"1\" refers to the opinion itself, \"N\" refers to supporting institutional rules. Last month, we released 4 supporting policy documents including strictly controlling IPO admission and strengthening continuous supervision of listed companies. Today we will also release supporting policy documents on strengthening delisting supervision, and publicly solicit opinions on 6 specific institutional rules. Exchanges also have a batch of self-regulatory rules simultaneously soliciting opinions. Next, we will study and formulate reform measures to promote long-term capital market development based on in-depth research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main theme of the \"1+N\" policy system is strong supervision, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development. This is an organic whole that complements each other and must be advanced together and implemented systematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of strong supervision, we will construct a comprehensive, three-dimensional capital market regulatory system and fully implement supervision that is \"sharp-toothed and thorny\" with clear edges. Listed company supervision should highlight full-chain supervision and enhance investment value of listed companies, continuously focusing on three aspects: strictly controlling listings, strict continuous supervision, and strengthening delisting supervision. Institution supervision should promote return to origins, optimize and strengthen, further consolidate \"gatekeeper\" responsibilities, and guide securities, futures, fund and other industry institutions to correct business philosophies and improve compliance levels, professional service capabilities and core competitiveness. Actively cultivate rational investment, value investment, long-term investment concepts and healthy investment culture. Trading supervision should promote fairness and efficiency, regulate trading behaviors of various entities and funds, severely crack down on illegal activities that disrupt markets, and maintain open, fair and just order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of risk prevention, we will propose a series of mechanism arrangements and policy measures from aspects including maintaining stable market operation, preventing and resolving risks in key areas, improving expectation management mechanisms, and coordinating opening up with security. In particular, we must enhance the inherent stability of capital markets, improve risk monitoring and disposal mechanisms, and focus on stabilizing confidence and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of promoting high-quality development, we will conscientiously implement the requirements of the Central Financial Work Conference to do well in the five major financial articles, further improve the multi-level capital market system, enhance the adaptability and inclusiveness of capital market systems, promote capital formation, better serve innovations in new industries, new business models and new technologies, and effectively promote the development of new quality productive forces. Currently, we are combining comprehensive evaluation of capital market reforms, extensively listening to opinions and suggestions from all parties, studying and improving relevant systems and rules, and promoting continuous deepening of important system reforms such as stock issuance registration system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Form Co-construction, Co-governance and Sharing Effective Capital Market Governance**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Promoting high-quality capital market development requires joint efforts from all parties. What arrangements does the opinion make in this regard?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** Capital markets have many participants and complex operating mechanisms. In a good market ecosystem, institutional investors and individual investors coexist and grow together, long-term and short-term funds each find their place, issuers and investors achieve mutual success, all market participants fulfill their responsibilities, and regulation and markets interact benignly. This requires all relevant parties to work together to properly grasp various balance relationships including investment and financing, primary and secondary markets, entry and exit, on-exchange and off-exchange, forming effective governance of co-construction, co-governance and sharing in capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"Nine Articles\" make arrangements for many key contents. For example, in promoting medium and long-term capital inflows, it both emphasizes vigorously developing equity public funds as the \"basic foundation\" and focuses on creating a policy environment that attracts, retains and develops well, promoting inflows of long-term capital such as insurance funds, social security funds, and pension funds, with classified deployments. For another example, the opinion emphasizes strengthening rule of law, proposing many hard measures around substantially increasing the cost of capital market violations, and improving three-dimensional accountability systems combining administrative, criminal and civil measures. We believe that as long as we persist in implementing these measures, capital markets will surely become more clear and peaceful. For another example, the opinion puts forward requirements for deepening central-local and inter-ministerial coordination and linkage. We will continue to strengthen work coordination with all parties to promote the formation of strong synergy for high-quality capital market development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Build Regulatory Iron Army with Strong Politics, Capabilities and Work Style**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: The opinion puts forward requirements for strengthening the CSRC's own construction, and the CSRC has also issued relevant documents. What specific measures are there in this regard?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** To forge iron, one must be strong oneself. The new \"Nine Articles\" put forward clear requirements for strengthening regulatory team construction, and we have already made arrangements. We will more prominently strengthen political construction, continuously consolidate and expand results of studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era through thematic education, deeply advance comprehensive strict Party governance, implement requirements for strict supervision and strict management with inward-facing determination for comprehensive self-construction, and drive comprehensive strict supervision work through comprehensive strict self-construction. Strengthen coordination and linkage with stationed disciplinary inspection and supervision groups, solidly advance central inspection rectification, focus on eradicating soil conditions that generate corruption problems, and promote \"not daring, not being able, and not wanting to be corrupt\" in an integrated manner. Regarding the prominent issues of government-business \"revolving doors\" and escapist resignations that all parties pay close attention to, we have already introduced more than 20 measures, implementing comprehensive policies from business and management ends. We will deepen special governance in this area, persist to the end, and show no mercy. In summary, we will focus on building a regulatory iron army with strong politics, capabilities and work style, providing strong guarantee for strict supervision, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality capital market development.\n",

      "Zhu Xincun, Chairman of the China Association of Entertainment Equipment Technology, delivered an online address. He stated that the content of this observation seminar covers the entire industrial chain, including construction, design, technology, machinery, and operation. When the Association's Performing Venue Design Branch was established on August 28, 2022, he pointed out that the idling of China's performing venues is a relatively serious problem. In response to this issue, the association organized relevant departments and professionals to conduct a series of inspections and research work. The relevant research report is being written, and a special forum addressing this issue is also in preparation. He hopes that during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, the association can contribute to government policy-making, focusing on the application of multi-functional venues in China's future performing venue construction, enabling China's performing venues to develop more scientifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deputy Secretary-General Ni Min delivered an on-site address on behalf of the China Association of Entertainment Equipment Technology. She pointed out that since its establishment, the Performing Venue Design Branch has consistently committed to strengthening the cross-integration between the cultural tourism and performing arts industry and the architectural design industry. Over the past two years, the branch has organized a series of activities, deepening academic exchanges and cooperation within the industry. Facing new circumstances, the branch focuses on developing the entire lifecycle industrial chain of performing building planning, design, construction, equipment, and operation and maintenance, with architectural design as the leading force. It aims to build a \"four-in-one\" platform comprising performing building design experts, performing venue technology design experts, performing equipment technology experts, and performing group creative personnel. Centered on the goal of cultural development and prosperity, it seeks to break through a number of common key technologies, enhance independent innovation capabilities, strengthen technological integration innovation and model innovation in the cultural field, and promote the mutual integration of culture and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made several suggestions for the branch's future work: First, according to high-quality development requirements, continuously stimulate the innovation vitality of performing venues to meet people's new expectations for spiritual and cultural life. Second, cultivate and strengthen a group of backbone enterprises and professional research talent teams with market competitiveness and industry influence, promoting the scientific and reasonable construction of talent teams for the entire lifecycle and industrial chain of performing venue building planning, design, construction, technology, and operation and maintenance. Third, establish professional working research groups relying on various professional design institutes. Last year, the association successfully applied for the 2024 Ministry of Culture and Tourism Social Science Project \"24DY46 - Research on Countermeasures and Paths for Improving Resource Utilization of Performing Venues,\" hoping to provide channels for reflecting industry voices. Fourth, the branch should focus on venue construction in the future, planning and coordinating the construction of cultural tourism ecological circles around performing venues, becoming an important carrier for promoting high-quality development of the cultural tourism industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman Wang Shuping pointed out in his address that the main content of this activity centers on the Chang'an Le - Belt and Road Cultural and Arts Center project, focusing on the project's architectural design, stage technology, stage machinery, acoustic design, and operational design, representing a diverse exchange of performing venue design. This highly aligns with the purpose of the Performing Venue Design Branch, which is to promote industry cross-integration and jointly advance the scientific planning and design of domestic performing venues, integrate and optimize equipment technology, expand comprehensive usage functions, and promote high-quality integrated development of performing venue design and performing equipment.\n",

      "Peng Hao, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and General Manager of China Northwest Architectural Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd., pointed out in his address that the world is currently experiencing unprecedented changes in a century, with a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation emerging vigorously. Cross-field and cross-industry integrated innovation is an important path for current industrial upgrading and industry expansion. The Chang'an Le project of the \"Belt and Road\" Cultural Exchange Center is an exemplar of integrated innovation practiced by China Northwest Institute in performing venue projects. This project is designed by Zhao Yuanchao, National Engineering Survey and Design Master and Chief Chief Architect of China Northwest Institute, and is a composite cultural and arts center that fully integrates cultural arts, leisure, commerce, and ecology.\n",

      "Wen Qinglin, Vice Chairman of the China Association of Entertainment Equipment Technology, and Chang Xinping, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Office, also delivered enthusiastic addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Master Zhao Yuanchao gave a report titled \"Music Rises from Chang'an - Thoughts on Urban Order and Characteristics,\" deeply exploring the synergistic relationship between urban development and architectural design, and how to promote the continuous inheritance of culture and history through innovative design concepts. Master Zhao Yuanchao proposed that architectural design no longer focuses solely on the function and aesthetics of individual buildings, but pays more attention to their role in the overall urban space. This design philosophy prompts architects to consider the relationship with the surrounding environment when creating new buildings, and how to reflect and strengthen the cultural characteristics of the city. He mentioned that modern architecture should reflect regionality, while regional architecture should also be modernized, a concept that has been embodied in multiple architectural projects in Xi'an. As a historical and cultural city, Xi'an should be able to bring new vitality and functions to the city through appropriate design and planning without destroying the traditional landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chang'an Le project is a comprehensive cultural and arts center that integrates cultural arts, leisure, commercial, and ecological functions. The project design inspiration comes from the traditional instrument \"xun,\" incorporating its abstract form into the architectural design, making the entire building complex present unique cultural characteristics, aiming to become a new cultural landmark of Xi'an.

      "\n",
      "Flip Camera Smartphone\n",
      "Since most phones' rear cameras perform far better than front cameras, while users have a strong demand for front camera selfies, how can we equip the front camera with a larger sensor within the limited space of a phone while controlling costs?\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2013, OPPO released a smartphone equipped with a camera module that could rotate freely 206 degrees - the OPPO N1. This phone had only one 13-megapixel rear camera, but by rotating the camera module, it could achieve the effect of using the rear camera for front-facing selfies. As a result, this phone was quite popular among female consumers at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phone with the Most Cameras\n",
      "The Nokia 9 PureView has 5 cameras in total. Combined with the even distribution of flash and proximity sensors, many people visually mistook it for having 7 cameras total. All its cameras have the same specifications. Unlike other multi-camera phone solutions, each of its cameras is equipped with a 12-megapixel sensor and f/1.8 lens, with only two color lenses and the remaining 3 being monochrome lenses. When users take photos, all 5 cameras simultaneously capture photos with different exposures, then merge them into one high-quality photo. This solution was developed in collaboration between Nokia and Light, the manufacturer of the Light L16 camera, using Light's Lux capacitive camera control chip to manage these 5 cameras. Theoretically, this shooting solution can capture photos with more detail and color. However, in actual use, there are awkward scenarios where photo processing is slow after shooting, and computer software may even be required to fully display the shooting effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop-up Camera Smartphone\n",
      "For a time, the phone industry was fiercely debating whether to use punch-hole screens or full screens. At this moment, OPPO provided a completely new solution - the pop-up camera module.\n",
      "\n",
      "FindX is a full-screen phone released by OPPO in June 2018. Its biggest feature is designing the front and rear camera modules as one component, embedded in the body and mechanically raised and retracted. When the camera isn't needed, the lens module is completely hidden inside the body, giving FindX a \"true full screen\" with no punch holes and ultra-narrow bezels on top and bottom. In the retracted state, FindX's back is also a complete piece of glass, smooth as jade. This design is simple and elegant, and represents an extremely bold attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Card Camera Smartphone\n",
      "In 2013, Samsung unexpectedly launched a smartphone that looked like a card camera from the back but was indistinguishable from other phones from the front - the Galaxy S4 Zoom. Based on the Galaxy S4 mini, it added a feature that surpassed all smartphones on the market: a 10x (24-240mm) optical image stabilization lens with a 1/2.33-inch, 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor. The 10x optical zoom lens extends automatically when shooting, just like a card camera, giving you the satisfaction of holding a camera while shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Galaxy S4 Zoom seemed like a reasonable and creative phone, limited by the Android system and phone hardware performance of the time, people didn't realize the dream of replacing traditional cameras with phone cameras. Samsung later abandoned plans to launch more such products, which is regrettable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Innovation in Mobile Phone Screen Technology\n",
      "\n",
      "3D Naked-eye Smartphone\n",
      "Red, the camera brand that created the first mainstream 4K digital camera Red One, later turned to 8K camera development with its \"Weapon\" series, gaining recognition from many professionals and becoming a major photography equipment brand in Hollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, it launched a huge and heavy smartphone, the RED Hydrogen One. This phone had very high-end specifications for its time, featuring a naked-eye 3D holographic screen, large capacity battery, unique corrugated border design, and modular expansion connectors for professional camera accessories, with a uniquely designed rear shell. Its appearance design was consistent with Red's cameras, distinctive, appearing heavy and solid. However, its core selling point - the naked-eye 3D screen - became the most criticized feature due to limited usage scenarios and insufficient viewable content.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the lukewarm market response to the RED Hydrogen One, Red had to abandon its smartphone ambitions and refocus on high-end imaging equipment development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projector Phone\n",
      "Phone screens are ultimately limited in size. How can we freely enlarge phone screens for a better experience and more conveniently share phone content with friends around us? Samsung's Galaxy Beam, the first smartphone with projection capability released in 2012, provided a completely new approach. Using Android 2.3, the projection device at the top of the phone could project phone content as images with 15 lumens brightness and projection sizes up to 50 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having such a portable micro-projector in 2012 would indeed attract many consumers, but limited by the projection module's inability to compress further, this phone reached 12.5mm thickness, and the 15 lumens brightness was almost invisible in daylight, only barely usable in extremely dim spaces. These factors constrained the product's practicality and led to its market elimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "E-ink Screen Smartphone\n",
      "The YOTA dual-screen phone had two screens - a normal color phone screen on the front and an e-ink screen used in e-readers on the back. It was the world's first dual-screen and first e-ink screen phone. YOTA phones originated in Russia, later developed jointly with Chinese companies to launch the YOTA3 dual-screen phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The YOTA phone's dual-screen design aimed to extend phone battery life. In certain usage scenarios, like reading news, emails, or web pages, users could use the more power-efficient e-ink screen side. Only scenarios like watching videos or browsing images would use the color screen side.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this design was controversial from the first YOTA phone, and combined with non-flagship hardware specifications, YOTA phones ultimately became niche products that couldn't find survival ground in China's competitive phone market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dual-Screen Smartphone\n",
      "LG made many attempts exploring multi-screen phones, once launching a dual-screen phone with an external expandable screen forming a foldable phone-like style - the LG V50 ThinQ. This dual-screen format was popular among some gaming enthusiasts because it enabled split-screen setup between game display and control areas while gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later LG launched the LG Wing with two built-in screens, one rotatable 90 degrees. This phone's design was inspired by rotating slider phones from the feature phone era. This combination allowed different functions on two different-format screens - for example, when photographing, the horizontal screen could be used for framing while the vertical screen adjusted camera settings; when gaming, the horizontal screen displayed the game while the vertical screen controlled it. In actual use, many software applications weren't adapted, causing various malfunctions or inability to function normally, which was one of the main reasons this phone eventually exited the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Innovation in Mobile Phone Form Factor\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexible Screen Wrist Phone\n",
      "In 2019, Nubia released its pioneering \"wrist phone\" - the Nubia α - at the MWC conference in Barcelona, Spain. Its biggest core innovation was adopting flexible screen technology. Nubia believed future phones would gradually merge with wearable devices, and the Nubia α was designed for this purpose. The Nubia α used a 4.01-inch narrow flexible OLED screen with 960×192 resolution, worn like a bracelet on the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nubia α was Nubia's exploration of future phone forms, but its unusual form factor couldn't accommodate mainstream software, and its unfamiliar interaction methods and strange appearance design deterred many consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smartphone with Keyboard\n",
      "At the original iPhone launch, Jobs ridiculed traditional smartphones with various keyboards, ushering in the era of virtual on-screen keyboards replacing physical ones. BlackBerry phones, later beaten nearly to death by iPhone and Android phones, continued insisting on producing smartphones with built-in keyboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BlackBerry Passport was unconventional mainly because it adopted a very rare square screen combined with a full keyboard, making it look quite clunky overall. Released in 2015, once the touchscreen era began, its development trend couldn't be reversed, and consumers showed little interest in the physically-keyboarded BlackBerry Passport. This phone became the last to run BlackBerry's proprietary operating system. Afterward, BlackBerry switched to using Android as its operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion\n",
      "This time we've reviewed some representative \"unconventional\" phones in smartphone development history. Some of these phones' design concepts remain distinctive even today, and some are even regrettable. Technology always develops through countless explorations and attempts, maturing after countless failures. Let us remember them and continue witnessing future unconventional phones.\n",

      "Whether in theory or practice, new productive forces are a thought achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the scientific concept of new productive forces during his inspection in Heilongjiang, and later elaborated on it in multiple occasions, especially during a collective study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. In general, the proposal of new productive forces is an innovation and development of Marxist theory of productive forces, the latest achievement of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, the innovative core concept of political economy with Chinese characteristics, a clarion call at a critical moment in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and a strategic deployment for building a strong country and achieving national rejuvenation. Whether in theory or practice, new productive forces are a thought achievement that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history. To deepen the understanding of it, we need to grasp several angles and entry points.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the classic definition of productive forces in Marxist political economy. In classical Marxism, productive forces consist of three elements: laborers, means of production, and objects of labor. The historical development and dialectical unfolding of the three elements of productive forces contain the logic of the development of new productive forces. From the practice of economic and technological development, it can be seen that the objects of labor are related to new materials and new energy, the means of production are related to informatization, artificial intelligence, and high-end precision equipment, and the laborers are related to professional talents and industrial teams in the era of informatization and intelligence. This can also be understood in connection with Lenin's discussion on labor productivity. The comprehensive penetration of science and technology in the elements of productive forces and the improvement of labor productivity are the natural extension of the innovation of the elements of productive forces. Marx regarded labor tools as the main marker of an era, discussing the difference between hand mills and steam engines. In fact, the objects of labor and the laborers also have the qualitative characteristics of the times. Lenin regarded labor productivity as the fundamental criterion for socialism to defeat capitalism, which in fact incorporated science and technology into the system of productive forces. This enlightens us that every era has its own new productive forces, so the concept of new productive forces is a concept with universal significance, which can be incorporated into the system of Marxist political economy and productive force theory, with great theoretical significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the historical process of theoretical innovation of our Party since the reform and opening up. In the most general sense, the theory of productive forces is a theory about development. Since the reform and opening up, our Party has made a series of major innovative achievements in the theory of productive forces through theoretical and practical exploration. On the new journey of building a strong country and national rejuvenation, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the concept of new productive forces, achieving a major integration and synthesis of our Party's theory of productive forces. By placing new productive forces in such a historical context, we can have a deeper understanding of the historical significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the rapidly changing scientific and technological revolution. The scientific and technological revolution and the profound changes it brings are the main theme of the current era. General Secretary Xi Jinping's proposal of new productive forces is a high-level crystallization and innovative development of historical experience, indicating that our Party's understanding of the scientific and technological revolution and its laws has reached a new height. The focus of new productive forces is \"new\", the key is \"quality\", productive forces are the general theoretical connotation, \"new\" and \"quality\" are the issues and special requirements of the times, combined together, forming an organic body of theoretical innovation, covering the general requirements of developing productive forces and the special requirements of seizing the opportunities of the scientific and technological revolution, pointing out the bottlenecks and shortcomings in China's modernization construction, and indicating the focus and path to solve the problems. The theoretical achievement of new productive forces has enriched and improved the value function of Chinese-style modernization, from which we can deeply feel the power of the leader's thought, the theoretical courage and mission of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the significance of the concept for the times.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the world pattern of major-country competition and China-US strategic competition. Major-country competition is a movement of forces, with various forces intersecting, changing, and balancing, shaping the world pattern of a certain era, among which some major-country relations play a decisive role. Science and technology, especially high-tech, determine the fate of mankind, the rise and fall of a country, and are the true \"fundamental interests of the state\" that cannot be ignored. In a period after the founding of New China, the focus was on nuclear technology, and we developed \"two bombs and one satellite\" on the basis of being poor and blank. Now it is information technology, artificial intelligence, new materials, new energy, life sciences, etc., and we are catching up, but there is still a long way to go. Major-country competition is not only about scale, but also about quality; not only about total quantity, but also about structure; not only about stock, but also about increment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the contradictory movement of productive forces and productive relations. The contradiction between productive forces and productive relations is the basic concept of Marxism on social movement, and the two are in a permanent dialectical movement. The reform of productive relations to liberate and develop productive forces is the basic method of social transformation. We have carried out the revolution, carried out the reform, promoted development, and advanced modernization, which is a great cause. Over the past more than 40 years, it is the reform and opening up, the key move of contemporary China, that has changed the face of China, the face of the Chinese people, the face of the Chinese nation, and the face of the world. The cultivation and development of new productive forces also rely on the key move of reform and opening up. Now, there are still many institutional and structural obstacles that restrict talent cultivation, scientific and technological innovation, and the development of new productive forces. People have reflected on and urgently demanded the problems existing in talent cultivation models, scientific and technological management systems, scientific and technological innovation environments, achievement evaluation systems, intellectual property protection, and scientific and technological opening-up to the outside world. The proposal of new productive forces provides a rare historical opportunity and practical entry point for us to solve these problems and promote higher-quality reform and higher-level opening-up, which contains profound leadership art and methodological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should understand it from the new journey of building a modernized strong country and achieving the second centenary goal. The timely completion of the first centenary mission has provided a solid foundation and historical new starting point for the realization of the grand blueprint outlined by the 20th National Congress of the CPC. The proposal of new productive forces provides a new logical starting point and theoretical support for the new journey. China has been the world's second-largest economy for many years, but many industries are still in the middle and low end of the industrial chain, with the gap mainly in core competitiveness. The current international competition is a competition of science and technology, a competition of talents, and essentially a competition of high-quality productive forces. The one with better technology wins, and the one with better quality wins. The proposal of new productive forces has sounded the charge for advancing toward high-quality development.\n",

Taihang Water Town is adjacent to the picturesque Yi Lake to the west, the World Cultural Heritage site of the Western Qing Tombs to the north, and the Red Holy Land of Wolf Tooth Mountain to the south.

Dr. Lam Pui-yan, Vice President of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, pointed out that while Hong Kong has nearly 10,000 Chinese medicine practitioners, relatively few have served in the public healthcare system.

Training should not only involve imparting knowledge and skills but also provide opportunities to practice in appropriate environments.\"\n",

      "They helped property owners recover a decade-old residential special maintenance fund, exposed the truth behind a company's fake lawsuit involving millions of yuan in goods, and cut off the money-laundering black chain hidden behind the \"slow recharge discount\" for phone fees... The tangible results achieved by Shouguang Municipal People's Procuratorate in Shandong Province through case handling have won sincere praise from the public. Song Jiaode, the procuratorate's chief prosecutor, said: \"We will continue to take 'procuratorate serving the people with practical actions' as a handle, focus on the people's urgent difficulties and concerns, and use the power of the rule of law to safeguard the rights and interests of the people.\"\n",

      "Breaking the Deadlock of a Decade-Long Illness\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, an elevator in a certain residential area frequently malfunctioned. After the property owners applied for repairs, the property management company informed them that since the developer had not transferred the residential special maintenance fund to the special supervision account of the housing and urban-rural development department, the elevator malfunction in the community needed to be repaired at the property owners' own expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, 22 property owners had already paid the residential special maintenance fund to the developer when they purchased their homes. Why did they now have to pay out of their own pockets to repair the elevator? Zhang and 21 other property owners repeatedly failed to reach an agreement with the developer, and the property owners' rights protection efforts became deadlocked. Later, Zhang and others went to the 12309 Procuratorate Service Center of Shouguang Municipal Procuratorate for help. After learning the details, Procurator Zhang Yongzhi suggested that Zhang and others could file a lawsuit in their individual names.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the court ruled in favor of the property owners, the developer delayed the execution of the judgment. Shouguang Municipal Procuratorate continued to follow up and supervise, and jointly studied solutions with the court, housing and urban-rural development, and financial departments. Finally, the court used the developer's prepaid quality assurance deposit in the financial bureau's account as the execution target and promptly transferred it to the special account for residential special maintenance funds of the housing and urban-rural development department, supporting the claim of the parties involved and avoiding the escalation of the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the basis of handling this case, Shouguang Municipal Procuratorate issued a procuratorial suggestion on social governance to the housing and urban-rural development department, urging it to improve the management mechanism for residential special maintenance funds, strengthen digital supervision, and increase the publicity of policies related to residential special maintenance funds. The housing and urban-rural development department, through upgrading and transforming the digital management system for residential special maintenance funds and conducting policy lectures, promoted the standardized and orderly use of residential special maintenance funds.\n",

      "Striking at False Litigation\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2023, the civil prosecution department of Shouguang Municipal Procuratorate discovered a case clue during its duties, which led to a false litigation case involving nearly 10 million yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, a certain trading company and a certain construction company signed a steel sales contract, agreeing that the trading company would supply steel of a specified brand. During the supply period, the construction company found that some of the steel brands did not match the contract terms and requested replenishment. However, the person in charge of the trading company, Yang, not only failed to replenish the 53 tons of steel, but also, together with the project manager Liu of the project, forged false vouchers, inflated the debt by 450,000 yuan, and filed a lawsuit with the court in June 2022. The court ruled in the first instance that the construction company should pay the trading company more than 950,000 yuan in goods, including the price of 53 tons of steel that was not actually supplied. Since the construction company did not appeal, the judgment took effect and was executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This case seems ordinary, but there are obvious contradictions between the receipts submitted by the parties and the supply records, especially the details that the replenishment was not completed but was claimed to have been fulfilled, which may involve false litigation.\" said Procurator Cao Weidong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through reviewing the case files and questioning key witnesses, the procuratorate gradually verified the details of the supply and receipt, and finally found out the fact that Yang forged the goods receipts and increased the goods price to file a lawsuit with the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "False litigation not only harms the interests of enterprises, but also erodes judicial credibility. Yang's behavior involved false litigation, leading to incorrect factual findings in the judgment, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, and disrupting judicial order. The procuratorate therefore filed an appeal with Weifang Municipal Procuratorate on May 5, 2023. On August 2, Weifang Municipal Procuratorate filed an appeal with Weifang Intermediate People's Court. On November 24, Weifang Intermediate People's Court ordered Shouguang Municipal People's Court to conduct a retrial. On July 12, 2024, Shouguang Municipal People's Court rendered a retrial judgment, reducing the original amount by nearly 400,000 yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Yang's and the trading company's false litigation behavior, the procuratorate simultaneously submitted a procuratorial suggestion to the court, and the trading company was eventually fined 100,000 yuan, and Yang was detained for 15 days, which effectively deterred dishonest litigation behavior.\n",

      "Cutting Off the Black Money Chain\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phone and electricity recharge enjoy a 70% discount...\" The seemingly favorable \"slow recharge discount\" may become a tool for criminals to \"whiten\" illegal money.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, during the handling of a case of concealing and hiding criminal proceeds, the procuratorate of Shouguang City discovered that the criminal gang built a \"slow recharge platform\" to attract consumers to place orders at low prices, and then transferred the illegally obtained funds from telecom fraud, online gambling, and other sources in batches into user accounts, and finally transferred the illegal money through virtual currency, forming a complete chain of \"black money turning white.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing the difficulties of anonymous operations and scattered fund flows, the procuratorate relied on big data to conduct source tracking and, together with the public security and financial supervision departments, established a special case team. After several months, they successfully identified key evidence, prosecuted 11 criminal suspects, and recovered illegal gains of more than 4 million yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Criminals take advantage of the public's pursuit of benefits to 'whiten' illegal funds through phone and electricity recharge methods, and even spread to water fees, fuel cards, shopping cards, game coins, live broadcast rewards, and other fields, causing great harm.\" said Bu Xianhui, a procurator of the economic crime prosecution department of the procuratorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve the problems of the long chain and difficulty in evidence collection of \"slow recharge money laundering\" crimes, the case handling team used big data technology to analyze the transaction flow of the platform layer by layer and accurately lock the destination of the illegal funds. In the past year, Shouguang Municipal Procuratorate has handled 3 cases involving 18 people who used phone and electricity \"slow recharge\" to conceal and hide criminal proceeds, and recovered and compensated 7.138 million yuan.\n",

      "Relying on the Nanchang rail-sea intermodal innovation, the \"Three-Same\" pilot work is carried out by providing enterprises with full-process railway freight subsidies, distance-to-depot collection and distribution subsidies, and smart port construction, gradually achieving \"same price to port as coastal areas for imports, same price to departure as coastal areas for exports, and same customs clearance efficiency as coastal areas.\" This accelerates the gathering of import and export goods from surrounding areas to Nanchang Xiangtang International Land Port New City, further reducing logistics costs for foreign-oriented enterprises, promoting the development of an open economy, complementing the logistics upstream and downstream industrial chains, and strengthening the port economic zone. At the same time, a fund turnover pool is established, with an annual allocation of 100 million yuan for the pre-payment of funds for the \"Three-Same\" policy and export tax rebates. Fully leveraging the role of the Nanchang Xiangtang to coastal ports international freight fast channel, Nanchang Xiangtang International Land Port New City is built into a \"direct express\" to the international market and an \"accelerator\" for the development of an open economy, promoting the construction of the Jiangxi Inland Open Economy Experimental Zone.\n",

Archaeology not only answers the profound question of \"where we come from and where we are going,\" but also provides an answer to the question of \"why China\" in this era.\n",

      "It takes only 10 minutes to complete the entire process of renewing a driver's license, and a single window can handle newborn registration. The process for replacing an ID card has been simplified, and temporary IDs are available \"on the spot.\" Since this year, the public security organs of Lincang City, Yunnan Province, have fully moved into the county-level government service centers. The city's public security service windows have been streamlined from the original 186 single-business windows to 138 comprehensive business windows. The number of full-time and part-time police officers and auxiliary police officers has been optimized from 476 to 380. The number of service items in the government service centers has increased from 32 to 133, with a public service satisfaction rate exceeding 98%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lincang Public Security Bureau is vigorously promoting the entry of public security administrative services into three-level government service centers, striving to transform from \"multiple windows for single police types\" to \"concentrated one-window processing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lincang City, the \"six-in-one\" comprehensive public security window for letters and visits, traffic police, drug control, public security, network security, and exit-entry has been set up in the county (district) government service centers. The \"three-in-one\" public security administrative service windows for letters and visits, traffic police, and public security have been opened in the convenience service centers of towns and townships. For townships that are temporarily unable to move in, the police stations and traffic police business windows are integrated to set up public security administrative convenience service stations. Currently, the comprehensive windows of all 8 counties (districts) in the city have been fully moved into the county-level government service centers, 32 police stations have been moved into the convenience service centers of towns and townships, and 8 police stations have integrated their business windows with the traffic police teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, they have established a \"dual-track\" service model of \"general + specialized\" according to the principles of \"one-window fast processing\" and \"specialized window precision processing.\" In the county-level public security administrative service windows, at least 50% of the comprehensive \"general\" windows are set up for one-stop reception, with backstage classification and approval, and comprehensive window issuance. \"One window can now perform the functions of three or four windows in the past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During the summer vacation, the public security comprehensive service window of Lincang City's government service center experienced a peak in business, with an average of 150 to 200 cases handled on-site per day, reaching over 300 cases at the peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To provide high-quality and efficient services to the public, we need to understand the business of all police types and learn as we go,\" said Chen Pin, a police officer at the window. Since being assigned to the public security comprehensive service window in December last year, Chen Pin, who originally only handled exit-entry business, has quickly become a \"versatile talent\" in the public security comprehensive service window in a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiming to achieve public satisfaction, Lincang Public Security Bureau has continuously strengthened its sense of responsibility, conducted regular business training, implemented a rotation system, and focused on ensuring capacity. At the same time, the window departments have improved and implemented the first-response responsibility system, service commitment system, time-limited handling system, and conditional handling system, and have compiled the business processing flowcharts for comprehensive windows, standardizing the guidelines and procedures for handling government services.\n",

      "Yang Xianyi was an extremely rare talent in the academic world, and his two sisters were also extraordinary. His elder sister, Yang Minru, was an expert in Chinese classical literature, and his younger sister, Yang Jingru (later changed her name to Yang Yi), was also a famous translator. They came from a scholarly family. Their father, Yang Yuzhang, received traditional Chinese education in his early years, later studied in Japan, and pursued economics at Waseda University. After returning to China, he served as the first president of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China. Through his own abilities, he amassed a fortune of millions, with the only regret being the lack of an heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife was pregnant eight times, but only two survived, and both were girls. Yang Yuzhang then took a second wife. In 1915, the second wife gave birth to a son, Yang Xianyi. The birth of the son was a great joy for the Yang family. After Yang Xianyi was born, he was taken away and lived with the first wife, becoming the most pampered darling of the family. Later, the second wife gave birth to two more daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the son was five years old, Yang Yuzhang suddenly fell seriously ill and died young, leaving behind a substantial fortune, as well as three women and six children (including a concubine and her daughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Yang Xianyi's mother was only 24 years old. She was determined to raise the three children well and ensure they received a good education. She came from a humble background, being a child from a poor peasant family in Hebei, with no money for schooling and little education. She was sold to the Yang family as a concubine. She was young and beautiful, intelligent, and won the genuine affection of Yang Yuzhang. Soon, she learned to read and write from her husband (she referred to him as \"Old Master\"). The couple had a deep bond and often read novels together. Through reading, she experienced a happiness she had never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the sweet days lasted only six or seven years before her husband suddenly left her, leaving her devastated. The only consolation was her three children. Because she gave birth to the only son in the family, Yang Xianyi, she received several ten thousand shares of stock as her share of the inheritance. Life was still relatively comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife was a rich young lady from a family of equal status to the Yangs, who had attended private school. Her greatest hobby was playing mahjong. She was kind-hearted and treated the two concubines and their illegitimate daughters fairly well. However, she believed in the saying \"a woman without talent is a virtue\" and never cared about the education of her two daughters. Yang Xianyi's mother, having experienced the benefits of education, secured opportunities for her two daughters to attend school. The two girls entered the American missionary school, Zhongxi Girls' School, the best girls' school in Tianjin at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the only son of this wealthy family and became the \"little emperor\" of the household from birth. He lived a life of luxury, and even as a child, he showed both intelligence and mischief. Once, he poured a bottle of his father's French brandy into the goldfish bowl, watching the \"drunken fish\" flounder in the bowl, which he found amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first wife sincerely hoped that this precious son would grow up smoothly and kept him with the girls—she believed that girls were of \"low status\" and easy to raise. The eldest and second daughters were the first wife's daughters, Yang Xianyi was ranked third, the concubine's daughter was fourth, and Yang Minru and Yang Jingru were ranked fifth and sixth, respectively. Therefore, the uncles' children joked with Yang Xianyi, calling him \"Miss Yang the Third.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the \"jewel on the palm\" of the family. His sister Yang Minru still remembers: \"His toys were not ordinary. There was one we played with even as adults, which is the music box of today. Inside, it made a clinking sound, with a few men and women dancing, all dressed in the clothing of the Louis XIV era in France. That music box was very expensive. That was his toy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the little master was seven years old, the first wife worried about him being kidnapped, so for safety, she hired a former Qing dynasty scholar, Wei Ruzhou, to teach at home. Yang Xianyi began reading *The Three-Character Classic*, *The Hundred Family Surnames*, and later the Four Books and Five Classics, *Selected Readings in Ancient Chinese Prose*, Tang and Song poetry, laying a solid foundation in classical Chinese literature. Although he was not diligent, he always received praise from Old Master Wei. During this period, he also read many other books.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until Yang Xianyi was 13 years old that the first wife allowed him to attend the missionary school, Xin Xue Academy, for middle school.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II**\n",
      "\n",
      "At school, Yang Xianyi was still not diligent and spent more time playing. The classmate who always ranked first was very hardworking, while Yang Xianyi said, \"I won't compete with him, so I always rank second.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi also often played pranks. Once, during an algebra exam, some students couldn't solve certain problems. He wrote the answers on a piece of paper and passed them to others, even sticking one on the back of the teacher's clothes. The teacher monitored the exam, walking around the classroom, and the answers were seen by everyone... Later, the teacher discovered this and talked to him. He admitted it honestly. The teacher not only did not punish him but praised him for being honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Old Master Wei left the Yang family due to old age and poor health, his mother hired another tutor to teach Yang Xianyi and his two sisters English and mathematics. Although the children's academic performance was excellent, his mother, who was eager for her children to succeed, still hired a tutor, hoping to improve the siblings' grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two sisters admired their brother so much that they felt \"stupid\" in comparison. Yang Minru said: \"When he could recite the Thirteen Classics fluently, I hadn't even finished reading the Four Books and Five Classics. In junior high, he was already thinking about writing a novel in the chapter format.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru said: \"My brother was too smart. At the age of seven, he wrote classical poetry and could quickly compose couplets. The teacher at the time was named 'Xu Jiansheng.' My brother took a look and immediately composed a three-character couplet—'quick execution.'\" (\"Xu\" rhymes with \"quick,\" \"Jian\" with \"gun,\" and \"Sheng\" with \"execution.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The teacher, Xu Jiansheng, whose name was turned into \"quick execution\" by Yang Xianyi, not only did not get angry but was very happy to encounter such a talented student. It was also this Teacher Xu who laid a solid foundation in English for the three siblings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xu Jiansheng was from Guangdong, graduated from the English Literature Department of Sun Yat-sen University, and married to the surgeon Chi Shiqing. She got along very well with the Yang family. The children called her \"Teacher,\" and the mother called her \"Madame Chi.\" Later, the mother even had the three children recognize her as their \"godmother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yang residence was located on Garden Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, a large mansion with a rich and leisurely life, with daily chores handled by servants. The three Yang siblings went to the cinema every week, watching both Chinese and foreign films. The mother was both strict and lenient with the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru was a premature baby and had always been in poor health. The doctor advised the mother to let the child breathe fresh air in nature. In the summer of 1931, the mother took the three siblings and invited Teacher Xu Jiansheng to Beijing's Xishan to escape the heat. This was the first time the Yang siblings left Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidentally, Yang Xianyi's cousin, Yang Zhanwu, and his classmate from Nankai Middle School, Luo Pelin, were also vacationing in Xishan. Luo Pelin came from a wealthy family in Tianjin and was a top student in the class. That year, he graduated from high school and was waiting for the university admission results. The few young people became playmates, running up and down the mountain, singing, playing chess, and playing cards in the villa... Luo Pelin and Yang Minru got along very well, leaving a good impression on each other. Everyone had a great time during this trip to Xishan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, a few years later, two uncles squandered the father's inheritance. The Yang family had to sell the house on Garden Street. The eldest sister got married, the second sister died, the concubine took her daughter and left, and the large family dispersed. The first wife, the mother, and the Yang siblings moved to the French concession on Zhaofeng Road, living in rented houses. The large family gradually ate up their savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1934, Yang Xianyi graduated from middle school and was admitted to Yenching University. His grades were so excellent that the school allowed him to skip to the second year of college. At that time, one of his British teachers from middle school was returning to his home country for a vacation, and Yang Xianyi wanted to go to Oxford University in England with him. The first wife hoped he would stay to inherit the family property, but he insisted on leaving. His mother also supported his decision to study abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Yang Minru was admitted to the Chinese Department of Yenching University, studying under Gu Shun. In 1937, Yang Jingru graduated from high school and was admitted to the Chinese Department of Nankai University. The \"July 7th Incident\" occurred, and Nankai University was bombed. The following year, as a \"returning student\" of Nankai, she went to Kunming to attend Southwest Associated University.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Minru was studying at Yenching, she received a letter from Luo Pelin expressing his affection for her. At that time, he had graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University. Yang Minru told her mother about this during her vacation in Tianjin. The mother immediately found out that Luo Pelin's parents had already arranged a marriage for him and ordered her daughter not to have any contact with him. After graduating from university, Yang Minru studied for a year and a half as a graduate student under Professor Gu. During the winter vacation of 1939, she took her mother to Chongqing, the rear base of the war. The mother and daughter went to Chongqing with employees of the Bank of China in Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, several hundred people from the Bank of China in Tianjin went to Chongqing in a grand procession to establish a branch there. The bank manager, Pan, who had been a small clerk when Yang Yuzhang was the president, took good care of the Yang mother and daughter. However, the mother was always strong-willed and paid all the necessary fees on the way, refusing to take any advantage. At that time, if Yang Minru had wanted to find a job at the Bank of China, it would have been very easy. However, she wanted to be independent and rely on herself. Neither she nor her mother wanted to enter the Bank of China through connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they arrived in Chongqing, Yang Minru struggled to find a job to support herself and her mother. Because she was a graduate student in the Chinese Department of Yenching University,\n",

      "**Deepening the Study and Implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, *Thirty Lectures on Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era*, compiled by the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, was officially published. The book, divided into 30 thematic sections, comprehensively, systematically, and deeply expounds on the great significance, scientific system, rich connotations, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is an important supplementary reading material for cadres and the masses to deeply study and understand the thought. This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. While reading the chapters on comprehensive opening-up in this book, one cannot help but feel proud of the broad-mindedness and magnanimity of our Party in advancing the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up, and feel genuine pride in the ideological height, conceptual depth, and visionary breadth of our Party's theoretical innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1978, China has become increasingly open. Reviewing the 40 years of reform and opening-up, we have opened our doors to build our country and successfully achieved a great turning point from a closed or semi-closed state to all-round opening-up. Facing the new journey, we must advance China's economic development toward high quality in an even more open state to continuously meet the people's growing demand for a better life. Currently, the international situation is undergoing profound changes, and the world economy and the global economic governance system have entered an adjustment period. The undercurrent of protectionism in Western developed countries is gradually surging, and Western countries that once aggressively expanded outward have shown a tendency toward inwardness. Meanwhile, emerging markets and developing countries have shown a trend of collective rise, with international forces shifting toward \"the East rising and the West declining, the South rising and the North declining.\" At a time when the world is filled with uncertainty, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward the important strategic thinking of forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up. General Secretary Xi Jinping has considered the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up from the strategic height of human social development and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Seizing the opportunity to expand opening-up is not only a valuable experience for China's reform and development but also an inevitable path for national prosperity and development. For contemporary China, opening-up is not a strategic choice made by chance but a necessary strategic decision to achieve high-quality development. In fact, forming a higher-level opening-up pattern has become a key choice for contemporary China's destiny and whether it can realize the dream of national rejuvenation. Comprehensive opening-up is not optional but an important treasure for the Communist Party of China to lead the Chinese people to stride forward in the fierce international competition, catch up with the times, and realize the great cause of national rejuvenation. Looking around the world, comprehensive opening-up has become a dynamic and fundamental symbol of China's rapid development and prosperity, and a distinctive symbol of the Communist Party of China leading international relations in the new era with the most appealing and attractive power. Comprehensive and high-level opening-up is a distinctive feature of contemporary China and a distinctive characteristic of the Communist Party of China's governance in the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary driving force for accelerating the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Opening-up brings progress, while closure leads to backwardness. Human development is based on the improvement of productive forces, which in turn depend on the invention and improvement of technology. The invention and improvement of technology rely on human knowledge innovation and the accumulation of experience. Different environments are more conducive to enhancing people's creative thinking, and the exchange and mutual learning of different civilizations are conducive to the innovation and dissemination of knowledge. Only in the process of continuous expansion of exchanges can human wisdom be inspired, and human knowledge and technology be disseminated more widely. The Chinese nation has had a glorious past, which was achieved with a grand vision and broad-mindedness in an era of exchange and mutual learning with neighboring countries. We have also experienced a period of decline, which was the result of adopting a closed-door policy and indulging in self-admiration. Opening-up to the outside world is China's basic state policy and an important treasure for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the continuous achievements of socialist modernization. We should expand the scope of opening-up, increase the intensity of opening-up, and engage in mutual exchange, learning, and mutual learning with an increasingly wide range of cultures. In the process of mutual exchange, we should expand the vision of experience and thinking; in the process of mutual learning, we should accelerate the transfer of knowledge and skills; and in the process of mutual learning, we should inspire the emergence of new knowledge and new technologies. Ancient Chinese inventions once benefited the world, and many scientific and technological achievements of modern developed countries have also promoted China's development. The Chinese nation should have an increasingly broad-minded vision on the road to great rejuvenation. Only in this way can we inspire our creative vitality and enhance our competitiveness in the mutual collision of different cultures and civilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary prerequisite for expanding the broad world stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only in the vast ocean can dragons grow and thrive; small streams, muddy pools, or shallow ponds cannot nurture whales, only small fish and shrimp can survive. Marxism tells us that practice produces true knowledge and real results. But the size of the stage for practice often determines the breadth of practice; the size of the stage for undertaking a cause often determines the scale of the cause. The times create heroes, and heroes need a bigger stage. Struggle promotes national rejuvenation, and those who struggle also need more space. We expand opening-up to create a broader space and stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Human history has developed in the process of opening-up, and human civilization has also been disseminated and enriched in the process of opening-up. China is an ancient civilization, but it declined in modern times due to the closed-door policy of its rulers. At that time, the world, which had been isolated from each other, became increasingly interconnected due to the discovery of the New World, creating a stage for the rise of the Western world. Today, our opening-up to the outside world is not a return to the ancient Han and Tang dynasties' strategies toward neighboring countries, but a true move toward the world in the context of economic globalization, providing a broader stage for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up can we better coordinate the two markets, two resources, and two sets of rules at home and abroad. The new pattern of comprehensive opening-up involves not only material aspects but also human resources. We should seek out intelligent minds from around the world to serve our needs, coordinate the two types of talent resources at home and abroad, inspire more wisdom, and support the implementation of the innovation-driven strategy. Today, the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is to return to the center of the world stage. This stage has gone beyond the flat perspective of the ancient \"world\" and has become a global stage. Only by assuming greater responsibilities and playing a greater role in this global stage can we truly achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is a necessary choice for leading the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China's reform and opening-up and peaceful development are events of global historical significance at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, as China has one-fifth of the world's population. China's development has not only enabled the Chinese nation to shake off the state of poverty and backwardness since modern times but has also brought opportunities to the entire world's development due to its vast market with enormous potential. On this planet, the complex and increasingly close connections brought about by economic globalization have created a situation of \"you in me and I in you,\" forming a pattern of shared prosperity and shared adversity. However, some people have short-sighted views, loudly advocating \"free trade\" when it is to their advantage, but starting to build protectionist walls when it is slightly disadvantageous. Faced with this situation, China confidently adheres to expanding opening-up and strives to form a new pattern of comprehensive opening-up. To promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and achieve win-win cooperation, we must expand the breadth and depth of opening-up. Our Belt and Road Initiative is to build a new platform for international cooperation through connectivity, add new impetus to common development, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. The Belt and Road Initiative originates from China but belongs to the world. The Belt and Road Initiative is an open platform, and it should transcend the boundaries of different regions, civilizations, and stages of development. The Belt and Road Initiative is a path of cooperation and win-win results, and it should continue to extend and expand. As long as everyone clarifies the grand goal of connectivity and win-win cooperation, strengthens policy coordination, aligns development strategies, adheres to joint consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, strengthens policy communication, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds, relies on project-driven development, and deepens practical cooperation, it will surely promote the development and prosperity of all countries and benefit the peoples of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening-up is the inevitable path to demonstrating the vitality of socialism through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Socialism has become a reality in the tide of the international communist movement and can only develop and grow in the tide of international currents. By implementing reform and opening-up, we have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and ushered in a bright prospect for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by further comprehensively opening up can we inject strong momentum into the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and enable scientific socialism to flourish with strong vitality in China. China's door of opening-up is becoming increasingly open, not only promoting the continuous development and improvement of the road, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the world, demonstrating the realistic path for developing countries to modernize under the guidance of Marxism. It also provides a new choice for countries and nations that hope to accelerate development while maintaining their independence, and contributes Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to solving human problems.\n",

      "Liangshan Prefecture's Huili City is renowned as the \"Hometown of Pomegranates in China,\" with planting areas and production volumes ranking first among the country's eight major pomegranate-producing regions. Currently, it is the peak season for pomegranate harvesting and sales, attracting merchants from all over the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following trucks from across the country, the reporter entered the Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Co., Ltd. in Baicao Village, Lukang Town, Huili City. On the sorting assembly line, plump and vibrant pomegranates were selected, weighed, and loaded onto vehicles for export to Southeast Asia and other destinations, embarking on an international journey. \"Currently, our annual export volume is about 10,000 tons, with revenue of approximately 50 million yuan,\" said Zuo Zifeng, chairman of the Huili Wanqing Pomegranate Professional Cooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good products can't fetch good prices?\n",
      "CA storage creates time difference\n",
      "\n",
      "Zuo Zifeng is a native of Huili who has been growing pomegranates for over 30 years. He casually picked up a seedless pomegranate, peeled it, and proudly told the reporter, \"Look how good our Huili pomegranates are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even good products face sales challenges. \"In the past, our good products couldn't fetch good prices. When the market was bad, a year's work could be wasted,\" Zuo Zifeng said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason was that pomegranates are harvested in a concentrated period, leading to oversupply, and without a way to extend shelf life, farmers had to sell at low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain freshness and extend storage life, Zuo Zifeng began constructing controlled atmosphere (CA) storage facilities after extensive research. Today, a modern pomegranate trading center and auction market integrating pomegranate grading, online trading, information release, storage processing, cold chain logistics, financial services, and big data applications has been established in Baicao Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This 40,000-square-meter agricultural product sorting area includes 37 fruit and vegetable CA storage facilities for cold storage, with a capacity of 6,500 tons,\" Zuo Zifeng explained. The CA storage adjusts marketing peak and off-peak seasons, allowing sales to be timed strategically. Pomegranates stored in CA facilities retain excellent brightness and freshness, enhancing market value and strengthening industry advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh fruits exported domestically and internationally\n",
      "Integrated production, supply, and sales boost income\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving storage and preservation issues means Huili pomegranates can reach farther markets. However, low efficiency and weak channels still hinder the journey of agricultural products. To go further, the entire agricultural \"production, supply, and sales\" chain must be connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Wanqing Agricultural Products Logistics Center in Baicao Village, a larger area is dedicated to offline sorting, packaging, and e-commerce operations. Over 100 distributors from across the country have settled here, with the logistics center providing cold storage, turnover bins, steel shelves, sorting equipment, forklifts, and other facilities for e-commerce use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On one hand, through cooperation with companies, cooperatives, and farmers, we provide production technology guidance to ensure high-quality products enter the market. On the other hand, by collecting user information, we precisely formulate sales plans, establish fruit standards, achieve grade classification, and sell through multiple channels,\" Zuo Zifeng introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting facilities such as socialized service systems, e-commerce service centers, Huili pomegranate auction centers, and supply chain systems promote the construction of the Huili pomegranate brand culture. They also help Huili agricultural products establish sales channels nationwide and even overseas, assisting farmers in increasing income through online and offline platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, refrigerated trucks loaded with pomegranates depart from Huili, passing through Panzhihua and Kunming, and exiting the country at the Xishuangbanna border, reaching Bangkok, Thailand, in about eight days.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Huili City Agriculture and Rural Bureau Pomegranate Office, Huili has established a 400,000-mu high-quality pomegranate industry belt with this year's production reaching 7.74 million tons. Huili will strive to consolidate and improve the construction and management level of provincial-level parks, focusing on cultivating and developing the entire pomegranate industry chain. Through building bases, creating brands, processing, and promoting integration, it will drive the high-quality and high-integration development of the pomegranate industry, effectively boosting farmers' sustained and stable income.\n",

      "For a long time, the China Petroleum Geophysical Research Institute has focused on solving exploration and development challenges in the Tarim Basin, independently developing advanced seismic exploration technologies for ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs. The institute emphasizes the standardization, systematization, and normalization of technical methods, providing strong support for efficient exploration and development in the Northwest Oilfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengthening Basic Research to Lay the Foundation for Technological Innovation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are closely related to strike-slip fault geological activities, forming unique fault-controlled reservoirs. Researchers have developed a \"follow-the-thread\" technical approach of \"first finding strike-slip faults and then exploring oil and gas reservoirs.\" However, due to the deep burial of the reservoir targets, the artificial seismic reflection signals returning to the surface are weak and are also affected by desert near-surface and deep high-velocity igneous rock shielding, making signal \"decryption\" even more difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these challenges, researchers have established a series of three-dimensional seismic geological models of strike-slip fault systems and ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs in the Tarim Basin. Based on three-dimensional numerical simulation and physical simulation methods, they have conducted research on the propagation mechanisms of seismic waves in ultra-deep complex fault-controlled reservoirs, summarizing the propagation laws and seismic response characteristics of seismic waves in different structural styles of fault-controlled reservoirs. These fundamental research achievements provide analytical bases for later seismic deployment and interpretation, offering theoretical support for optimizing seismic data acquisition parameters and improving imaging precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the institute has promoted basic research on rock physics in the ultra-deep field, building high-level experimental platforms and key technologies. Aiming at the ultra-high temperature and pressure underground environment of ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs, they have established the industry's first comprehensive rock physics testing platform for wells with depths of up to 10,000 meters, advancing the experimental capabilities of rock physics under high temperature and pressure from less than 5,000 meters to more than 12,000 meters. This has driven the development of deep and ultra-deep rock physics experimental equipment and technologies in the global oil and gas industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on ultra-high temperature and pressure testing, researchers have clarified the temperature and pressure dependence of high-temperature and high-pressure ultrasonic sensors, developed sensor temperature and pressure correction technologies, revealed the rock physics properties of major diagenetic minerals in carbonate rocks under high temperature and high pressure, and constructed rock physics models and interpretation templates suitable for deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs. These achievements have been applied in the identification of ultra-deep geological targets and the prediction of engineering \"sweet spots,\" resulting in multiple original theories and achievements supporting the integration of geophysical exploration and engineering in \"deep earth projects.\"\n",

      "**Seismic CT Imaging Opens a High-Definition Underground Window**\n",
      "\n",
      "Seismic processing and imaging technology is akin to performing a CT scan on the Earth, serving as a crucial means to open a high-definition underground window.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the issues of weak seismic reflection energy and low signal-to-noise ratio in ultra-deep layers, the institute has gradually developed a \"two-wide, one-long, one-small\" (wide azimuth, wide frequency band, long array, small element) seismic acquisition technology. This effectively reduces the signal shielding effect of shallow abnormal velocity bodies, enhances the effective seismic reflection information in ultra-deep layers, and obtains high-quality data containing more azimuthal reflection information. This significantly improves the identification capabilities for ultra-deep complex structures, geological anomalies, faults, lithology, and physical properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harsh desert surface conditions and complex underground structures lead to the development of various types of interference waves with strong energy, significant near-surface absorption attenuation effects, and severe signal shielding and interference from special rock bodies. To tackle these challenges, researchers have innovatively developed a \"three-protect, one-test\" (protect refraction, protect amplitude, protect low-frequency weak signals, parameter testing to pre-stack time migration imaging) processing technology series. This includes technologies such as ultra-deep weak signal protection denoising based on desert surface conditions, near-surface Q compensation, amplitude and wavelet consistency processing, and layer-controlled data-driven interlayer multiple wave suppression. These advancements enhance the energy and signal-to-noise ratio of effective seismic signals, expand the effective frequency bandwidth, and provide high-fidelity seismic data for subsequent seismic imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the precise imaging challenges of ultra-deep target oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, researchers have innovatively developed a series of full-azimuth angle-domain imaging and wideband high-end reverse time migration imaging technologies. Full-azimuth angle-domain imaging fully utilizes wide-azimuth seismic information to perform imaging in the underground local angle domain, multi-dimensionally depicting the contours and internal structures of fault-controlled reservoirs and dissolution cavities. Based on the theory of reverse time migration of resolved wavefields, researchers have innovatively developed anisotropic reverse time migration imaging technology, effectively reducing the impact of fracture heterogeneity. They have also developed wideband Q compensation reverse time migration imaging technology to effectively compensate for the attenuation effect of effective signals during long-distance propagation. Additionally, they have established high-resolution least-squares reverse time migration technology to perform underground illumination compensation, improving the imaging precision of steeply dipping structures and ultra-deep small-scale anomalies.\n",

      "\n",
      "To address the issues of insufficient resolution, poor channel matching, and high computational load in conventional P-wave impedance inversion, researchers have adopted a new semi-supervised learning approach. They have innovatively developed an adaptive deep convolutional neural network-based P-wave impedance inversion method, solving the application difficulties of the original model. By combining model-driven and data-driven approaches, they have improved the interpretability of the seismic inversion process and results, achieving significant effects in describing small-scale cavity clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle the challenge of predicting the grading of ultra-deep strike-slip faults, researchers have developed a machine learning-based fracture grading prediction technology and conducted tests, achieving good application results. This technology establishes the relationship between seismic attributes and drilling losses, improving the efficiency and accuracy of fracture detection and promoting the development of precise prediction technology for strike-slip fault zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the challenge of quantitatively characterizing ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs, researchers have innovatively developed a quantitative description technology for fault-controlled reservoirs based on frequency-varying attributes. By fully exploiting the differential characteristics of reservoirs in the frequency domain, they have made breakthrough progress in multi-scale cavity cluster prediction and correction, and quantitative characterization of fracture scales. For the first time, they have proposed the concept of the fracture scale index (FSI), establishing a complete workflow from basic theory, algorithm design, forward modeling, practical data application, to effect evaluation. This has formed a technical solution for evaluating reservoir connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the masking effect of strong reflections at the top of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation on the underlying fault-controlled reservoirs, researchers have innovatively optimized the matched tracking strong reflection separation technology. This significantly reduces the interference of strong reflections on the description of deep fault-controlled reservoirs, creating more favorable conditions for the quantitative description of fault-controlled reservoirs. Currently, this technology has been integrated into the latest version of the NEWS software and has become an essential step in the quantitative description of fault-controlled reservoirs in the Shunbei area, effectively improving exploration success rates and economic benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, seismic technology has gradually evolved from two-dimensional exploration to three-dimensional, four-dimensional, and five-dimensional exploration, supporting the discovery of various types of oil and gas reservoirs in the Northwest Oilfield, including structural oil and gas reservoirs in the Triassic Tarim River, stratigraphic oil and gas reservoirs in the Yakela dome, karst cave-type oil and gas reservoirs in the Ordovician Tarim River, and fault-controlled cave-type oil and gas reservoirs in Shunbei. The exploration depth has been extended from 4,200 meters to 7,900 meters, effectively promoting the discovery and increased production of various types of oil and gas reservoirs in the Northwest Oilfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the institute will continue to focus on key geological targets such as the spatial structure, small cavity clusters, secondary fault zones of the Tarim River, and the spatial structure, filling types, and fault-reservoir relationships of ultra-deep fault-controlled reservoirs in Shunbei, supporting high-quality exploration and development in the Northwest Oilfield.\n",

It has cost advantages in what it produces itself. The supplies from German Bosch to BYD are at the lowest price, the best customer level. Other domestic companies don’t get this treatment. BYD is confident, not just because it has funds, but because it holds the technology. Technology can be exchanged for funds, and technology can also be exchanged for technology. Without technology, your price is set by others. With technology, everyone needs it, and you can negotiate. Because BYD uses its own ESP to negotiate with Bosch, meaning if you don’t give me the best price, I’ll make it myself, and with increased production, I might even sell it to other automakers.

      "Reported by (Shenyang Daily, Shenyang Full Media Reporter Li Li) On February 26, the first primary school in Xinchengzi Street, Shenyang New District, held a lecture on reform and opening-up education themed \"Learning the Four Histories, Striving Together\" in the school campus. The school's moral education director, Miao Fengjiao, vividly explained to the students present the historical background, development process, and significant importance of the reform and opening-up. Through comparisons before and after the reform, the students learned that since 1978, the motherland has carried out reforms in many fields, released rural labor, and promoted rapid industrialization. This has transformed China from a relatively closed and backward country into the world's second-largest economy, marking a major turning point in Chinese history. During the lecture, the students actively interacted, raising their questions and ideas. Miao Fengjiao patiently answered them and encouraged the students to deeply study history, cherish the current good life, and strive for the realization of the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This lecture enhanced the students' patriotic feelings and national pride, deepened their understanding and recognition of the history of reform and opening-up, and made them fully realize that happiness comes from struggle.

      "**Reading Summary**\n",
      "In recent years, Tianmen City has vigorously developed the vegetable industry, with a total planting area of 420,000 mu and an annual output of 1.2 million tons. Guided by market demand, the city has focused on industry development shortcomings, taking multiple approaches to build a complete vegetable industry chain, leading industry upgrades and increasing farmers' income. Following the development concept of \"buying nationwide and selling nationwide,\" Tianmen is accelerating the construction of a vegetable distribution hub in central China, emphasizing the two core functions of \"concentration\" and \"dispersion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Autumn in Duobao is green.**\n",
      "Rows of thriving radish seedlings adorn the fields with vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duobao Town is the largest vegetable-growing town in Tianmen, with a radish planting area of 100,000 mu, an output value exceeding 400 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the town's total agricultural output.\n",
      "\n",
      "From selling small baskets of vegetables that never left Hubei to \"dressing up and marrying far away\" to reach the entire country, how did this radish town transform? On September 13, reporters from Hubei Daily visited Duobao Town.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Scattered to Clustered, the Radish Town Takes Shape**\n",
      "Watering, thinning, fertilizing, weeding... During the autumn planting season, over a hundred workers are busy in the fields of the vegetable planting base of Hubei Minghe Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd., located in Dazhong New Village, Duobao Town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is a leading enterprise in Tianmen's vegetable industry, with over 8,000 mu of self-cultivated vegetables and more than 20,000 mu of contract farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, we wouldn't even dare to dream of such a scale,\" said Wu Hanping, the company's chairman. He began planting vegetables in 2012, when manual planting was the norm, mechanization was low, and 300 mu was the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Duobao Town mainly grew cotton, wheat, soybeans, and other crops, with vegetables only scattered among individual households. Production was low, quality was poor, and the market was difficult to penetrate... Wu Hanping and other large growers frequently traveled to Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, and other places to learn advanced vegetable planting concepts and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, vegetable seedlings had to be bought from outside, with prices as high as 1 yuan or even 1.5 yuan per seedling, driving up costs,\" Wu Hanping said. In 2017, the company decided to build its own seedling greenhouse. At the time, solar greenhouses were popular, but he insisted on building a multi-span greenhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar greenhouses can only be used for a few months in autumn and winter, while multi-span greenhouses can freely adjust temperature and humidity, allowing year-round seedling cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the multi-span greenhouse seedling facility of Minghe Company, reporters saw advanced facilities such as wet curtain cooling, automatic irrigation, integrated water and fertilizer, and heating and supplemental lighting, all exuding a strong \"tech vibe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, with the rise of facility agriculture and the advancement of agricultural mechanization, Duobao's vegetable industry has rapidly expanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, radishes had to be hand-sown, with one person able to sow only one mu per day. Later, with the widespread use of sowing machines, one machine could complete 100 mu in a day. Now, except for weeding and harvesting, the entire process is almost fully mechanized, with an average yield of over 8,000 jin per mu in normal years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganlu Village is a well-known vegetable-growing village. Village Party Secretary Wen Yuanjun introduced that the village has over 3,000 mu of vegetable planting, radiating over 10,000 mu in the surrounding area. It is common for large growers in the village to earn over 100 million yuan annually, while ordinary villagers can earn over 100,000 yuan a year through land transfer fees and working in cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Duobao Town's vegetable planting area is stable at around 120,000 mu, with varieties expanding to over 30 types, including peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. This has driven approximately 26,000 vegetable-growing households, with an average increase in income of 12,000 yuan per household.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Single to Diverse, Radishes Also Have \"Grades\"**\n",
      "No matter how good the quality of agricultural products is, if the market channels are not smooth, they will only rot in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days, due to poor logistics and information flow, the sales radius of Duobao radishes was limited to the surrounding areas of Tianmen. Wu Hanping has deep feelings about this: \"For more distant wholesale markets, the price quoted over the phone was over 1 yuan per pound, but by the time the radishes were transported, the price had dropped to a few jiao.\" From the initial stage of sending people to major markets to inquire about prices to now being able to browse national market price lists online, the bottlenecks in information and logistics have been resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the smooth flow of information and logistics has turned the entire country into a large market, making competition increasingly fierce. For radishes to travel far and sell well, stable quality is the top priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minghe Company has promoted the implementation of \"three increases and three reductions\" healthy cultivation technology for vegetables, reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by 5% each, reducing labor costs by over 13% per mu, and increasing production by over 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The renewal of sales concepts is equally important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Duobao radishes were still in the stage of being sold with soil, directly loaded from the field without classification or grading, let alone packaging. Purchasers had to spend manpower, resources, and time on classification and sorting, resulting in costs far higher than those of other mature suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the segmentation of market consumer groups, agricultural products must be strictly classified and sold according to standards to create price differences and sell well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Duobao radishes are classified into four grades—premium, standard, small radishes, and substandard—based on size, weight, and appearance after being put on the market. The price difference between premium and standard grades exceeds 3 jiao per pound. \"The sorted premium radishes not only have appearance but also value. They are now sold individually as vegetable gift boxes,\" Wu Hanping said. Now, Duobao vegetables have successfully entered major food supply chain platforms such as Wangjiawan, Qian Da Ma, and Duoduo Buy Vegetables, directly supplying thousands of households across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, Minghe Company's vegetable sales reached 80 million yuan, and this year, it is expected to achieve continuous growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**From Learning to Exporting, Duobao Farmers Travel to Other Provinces \"on Business\"**\n",
      "On September 15, a truck loaded with white radishes drove into Minghe Company, and workers who had prepared in advance proceeded with washing, sorting, and packaging in an orderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The radishes in the town had just been planted, so why were they already washing radishes here?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is what we planted in Shaanxi,\" Wu Hanping revealed. Due to the selfless aid during the epidemic, last year, Wu Hanping was invited to visit Shaanxi. The local government repeatedly invited them to develop agricultural planting and help local farmers get rich. After repeated inspections and experiments, they have now leased 400 mu of land in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, for vegetable planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to geographical differences, vegetables can be planted in Shaanxi as early as June or July, with the harvest period perfectly staggered with Tianmen. Wu Hanping said, \"In recent years, we have accumulated good reserves of planting technology and financial strength. Now, we are trying to go out to extend the planting chain and achieve differentiated competition.\" Wu Hanping said that the next step will be to continue expanding the provinces where they plant vegetables in the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wu Hanping is not the only one to plant vegetables in other provinces. In Ganlu Village, five cooperatives have already planted over 3,000 mu of vegetables in Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wen Yuanzu, the head of Shunfa Vegetable Professional Cooperative, said that the scale of contiguous planting in Duobao and surrounding areas has already reached a certain level, with land transfer prices exceeding 1,000 yuan per mu. In contrast, Shaanxi and other places have larger contiguous planting spaces and relatively lower land transfer prices, providing a clear cost advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, we went out to learn and catch up with the advanced planting technologies of other regions,\" Wu Hanping said. Now, when we choose to go out, we can achieve technological exports, expand the brand influence of 'Duobao radishes,' and continue to strengthen the Duobao radish industry.\n",

      "On May 26, the Shaling Gold Mine, a subsidiary of Laizhou Huijin Mining Investment Co., Ltd. under China National Gold Group Corporation, made history—the main shaft excavation and lining project reached a depth of 1,551.8 meters, setting a new record for the deepest vertical shaft excavation and lining in a single operation in Asia. The builders of Shaling have nurtured this fruitful achievement with wisdom and sweat, continuing to write the legend of ultra-deep vertical shaft construction for China National Gold Group and achieving outstanding results to welcome the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.\n",

      "Looking back at the construction of the Shaling main shaft project, as a demonstration project for the national \"Thirteenth Five-Year Plan\" key research and development project on \"deep earth resource exploration and mining,\" the main shaft project crosses the Jiaojia main fault, with complex geological conditions. Problems such as high temperature, high lifting, high ground stress, high osmotic pressure, large water inflow, and strong corrosion followed one after another, almost covering all the challenges faced by ultra-deep vertical shafts in China, making the construction extremely difficult. Faced with the rare unfavorable construction conditions in China, all the participating employees fully carried out the work style of \"act immediately and work practically,\" and since the start of construction in May 2019, they have taken the initiative, forged ahead, established a \"joint party cell\" to focus on overcoming construction difficulties, and pooled their wisdom to overcome eight major construction challenges, including deep vertical shaft construction efficiency, blasting efficiency optimization, grouting for water control, and equipment operation. They invited top experts from domestic research institutes to diagnose the situation on-site and continuously discuss treatment plans, forming a series of deep construction operation standards represented by wall grouting in deep and complex geological conditions, successfully filling many technical gaps in the field of ultra-deep vertical shaft construction in China. They have continuously consolidated the \"three basics\" (ideological, organizational, and disciplinary construction), fully leveraged the safety management advantage of \"everyone is a safety officer,\" and insisted on taking responsibility for safety production, polishing the \"safety foundation\" of high-quality project development. Success belongs to those who act, and achievements belong to those who persist. After three years of struggle, the project builders have forged a construction path of never giving up and daring to innovate. Commissioned for the \"golden cause\" of the nation, they fought in the depths of a kilometer-deep shaft and ultimately created the deepest shaft in Asia. The vast sea has no end, and the sails will rise with the wind. Taking the successful practice of the main shaft excavation and lining project as a starting point, a blueprint for the intelligent mining construction of deep vertical shafts, carrying countless dreams, is gradually unfolding on the fertile land of Shaling. Standing at a new starting point and looking ahead to a new journey, Laizhou Huijin Company will closely follow the strategic deployment of the group company's party committee, adhere to the new development philosophy, and persist in unremitting efforts to write a new chapter in building a world-class intelligent gold mine.\n",

      "Recently, at the \"Yuanjing Hill\" in Shanghai Himalaya Center, the second Natural Art Festival initiated by the public welfare organization Heren She was particularly eye-catching. On-site, young artists were immersed in performing with instruments and body movements created after staying in rural areas for days, while citizens were excited about experiencing natural activities such as peeling arrowroot, pickling vegetables, and playing bamboo music up close. Everyone felt the connection between humans and nature, art and the countryside in a special way. Chen Shisong, a reporter from the Youth Daily, reported that the public welfare organization supports young artists in creating spontaneously in rural areas, connecting humans with nature and art with the countryside. For Heren She, this is the soul of the organization and the central theme of all its projects. In 2014, Heren She launched the Natural Art Festival, inviting experts from various fields such as art, sociology, and design planning to discuss how to improve the relationship between humans and nature and between art and the countryside. This year, Heren She launched the second Natural Art Festival, taking a big step forward by expanding participation nationwide and initiating an artist-in-residence program in rural areas. Through various means, it supports artists in staying in rural areas for a period of time to draw inspiration and create spontaneously, truly bringing art and the countryside together. The first batch of rural residencies was located in Choudun Mountain Village, Kunshan. Three young artists who applied and received support came to the area. Natural artist Chen Zhipeng advocates for natural music and natural art perception and is the founder of natural music. The second, Zhou Weiwei, is a sound explorer, natural musician, and also studies calligraphy. The third, Fang Shenglan, is a body narrative artist. During this residency, the team conducted research and learned about the local natural scenery, root culture, and traditional music, sensing the interaction between the current environment and humans, and creating spontaneously on-site multiple times. The artists visited local writer Zhou Gang, listening to the old man tell the history of Choudun Mountain Village, the origin of the local scholar Gu Aying's Yashan gathering, the rise and fall of Kunqu opera master Huang Fan Chou, and the local puppet theater. The three artists followed the locals in morning field patrols, exchanged with the elderly, collected recordings, and created spontaneously on the street... They explored and discovered local culture from different angles while integrating their creations into daily life. \"Different places for exchange and spontaneity create different environmental atmospheres, which, in our view, is a natural state.\" After days of accumulation, a jointly created work, *Source·Sound Kunshan*, was born. At the opening ceremony of the second Natural Art Festival held recently, nearly 100 audience members watched the performance up close. \"These artists led us, the on-site audience, to experience another interpretation of natural art through instrumental performances and body movements. It was truly a very special experience,\" an audience member told the reporter. Academic heavyweights discuss art practice and rural development In addition to artistic performances, the Natural Art Festival also featured intellectual collisions. At the opening forum, guests and hosts sat around three large tables to discuss a topic related to nature and art: \"The development of natural art in China today should return more to rural society,\" \"Traditional handicrafts are an art form that helps people understand nature,\" \"Using nature as a theme does not mean rejecting modern civilization...\" Everyone spontaneously wrote down their thoughts on large sheets of paper on the tables, allowing various inspirations to collide and spark unexpected ideas. The Youth Daily reporter learned that before the opening ceremony, the Natural Art Festival had already organized an advance forum. Members of the festival's academic committee, resident artists, representatives of this year's residency institutions, and representatives of institutions that may become future residencies gathered to discuss various cases of artistic practice in rural areas and community transformation experiences, and engaged in a dialogue from discovery to community creation on the relationship between artistic practice and contemporary rural development. The academic committee members of the Natural Art Festival are all heavyweights. Professor Zhang Lanying is the director of the Liang Shumian Rural Construction Center in Beijing and the executive deputy dean of the Rural Construction College of Southwest University. She has extensive practical experience in rural construction and has visited many countries. In her view, artists entering villages to create have their own dreams, and villagers also have their own dreams, and a balance must be found between them. Professor Pan Li is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the Shanghai University School of Fine Arts, specializing in Japanese art and public art research. Professor Pan hopes that whether it is the festival organizers or the artists themselves, when introducing art into rural areas, they should try to lower their posture and encourage villagers' participation and investment, gradually changing their values in the process. Han Bo, a former media person and now an independent artist, has long been involved in both art and media, and in recent years has begun creating art himself. He believes that the more open one's attitude, the more one can discover the subtleties of traditional culture, and the artistic creations based on this can transcend reality. Peeling arrowroot, pickling vegetables, playing bamboo music—open workshops attract huge crowds It is worth mentioning that the Natural Art Festival is not just for young artists and academic heavyweights, but also attracts many citizens to participate. At the opening ceremony, three open workshops were extremely popular, and both children and parents were eager to try and get close to nature. First was the Bamboo·Music Natural Instrument Workshop, led by natural music teacher Chen Zhipeng, who specially came from Dali, Yunnan. On-site, he taught everyone how to make a simple instrument by cutting bamboo and even led a small music performance. The scene was so lively that an additional workshop had to be temporarily added. The Folk Art Workshop was led by the popular teacher Wu Yun, who guided children in reading the original picture book *Pickling Vegetables* by Heren She, learning about the customs and traditions of pickling vegetables in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Natural plant expert Qiuqiu taught the children how to pickle vegetables on-site, which was very novel for children who grew up in the city. Everyone chose their favorite fresh vegetables, rubbed salt together, bottled them, and happily took their homemade pickled vegetables home. The Qingcheng Countryside Scenery Workshop also attracted unexpectedly high attendance and popularity. Many people have eaten arrowroot, but few have seen what fresh arrowroot looks like, and even fewer know how to peel it. The workshop team from Qingcheng, Kunshan, led everyone to learn about arrowroot knowledge, see many interesting photos, and personally learn how to peel arrowroot with \"copper fingers,\" experiencing what \"every grain is hard-earned\" means. After peeling the arrowroot, the children also played interactive games and quizzes, and everyone could taste a small cup of delicious and nutritious fresh arrowroot sugar water on-site. Lu Lu, founder of Heren She and artistic director of the Natural Art Festival, said, \"The Natural Art Festival, though initiated by Heren She, is far greater than Heren She. Under the name of ideals and within the rules, we respect each other's wisdom and rights, using imagination to transcend the boundaries of theory and method.\"\n",

      "Now, the snow-capped mountains of the Yellow River source stand majestically, lakes are scattered like stars, and rare wild animals such as black-necked cranes and wild yaks often appear... The latest statistics show that the ecological environment of the Three-River-Source region continues to improve, with the area of water and wetland ecosystems increasing by 309 square kilometers, the annual increase in water retention capacity exceeding 6%, and biodiversity continuously improving.\n",

      "The story of protecting the most beautiful ecology is also unfolding in Hainan's tropical rainforest—\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancient trees and vines grow together, misty air flows through winding streams. Looking at the vast rainforest before him, Hong Xiaojiang, who has witnessed the withdrawal of industrial and mining enterprises, often sighs: \"This 'treasure trove' is now truly being strictly protected!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hainan Tropical Rainforest is rich in tropical biodiversity and genetic resources. In the past, due to economic development needs, local areas once exploited natural resources in an unregulated manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the *Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park System Pilot Plan* was issued, clearly requiring that industrial and mining enterprises within the national park that do not meet protection and planning requirements be gradually shut down and relocated, and establishing a mechanism for the withdrawal of existing mining rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does the national park have to do with us?\" \"Why do we have to remove a good 'money tree'?\" Hong Xiaojiang, then head of the office of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Administration, still remembers the complaints and opposition at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, staff members patiently persuaded, held face-to-face meetings with enterprises, and coordinated on the front lines of mining operations, finally making the \"hard\" enterprises relent. By December 2021, all 10 mining rights within the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park had been revoked and withdrawn, and the rainforest welcomed long-lost tranquility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the withdrawal of mining enterprises has basically completed ecological restoration of the mining areas, and the once pockmarked mountains have been covered with new greenery. Dense forests, colorful sunsets, cascading waterfalls, and the increasingly clear footprints of various rare animals... The rainforest paradise that once only existed in dreams has become a reality.\n",

      "The autumn breeze in Jilin is cool. Deep in the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, Feng Limin, who is conducting autumn surveys, is attracted by a set of footprints and rushes forward. \"These are the footprints of a wild Northeast tiger, an adult female with two cubs!\" he said excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feng Limin is the deputy director of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard Monitoring and Research Center of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. According to him, for a long time, due to increased human activity, the habitat of wild Northeast tigers has disappeared and degraded, and the population has rapidly declined. By 1998, there were only 12 to 16 wild Northeast tigers left in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the state has successively taken measures such as establishing nature reserves, stopping commercial logging of natural forests, and clearing mountains and traps, achieving certain results, but problems still exist: protection work involves multiple departments and administrative regions, and the ecological system is fragmented, with serious fragmentation of Northeast tiger and leopard protection areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the pilot work of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park was launched, spanning Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and involving the transfer of administrative functions of seven departments, including land and forestry, to the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park Administration. Forest vegetation restoration, withdrawal of production and living activities in the core area, and the construction of tiger and leopard migration and diffusion corridors are being carried out continuously... All these measures are aimed at letting the tiger \"rule\" the forest again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, through the \"sky-earth integrated monitoring system,\" the movements of Northeast tigers and leopards can be seen in real time. The latest monitoring data shows that the number of wild Northeast tigers living stably within the park is about 70, and the number of wild Northeast leopards is about 80, with an activity range of more than 11,000 square kilometers, accounting for about 80% of the entire park area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only the Northeast tiger and leopard, the living environment of the \"national treasure\" giant panda has also been systematically protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, those concentric rings of bamboo forests are the 'cat paths' specially opened by the park for giant pandas and their symbiotic animals.\" Standing at the Machaohe Conservation Station in the Yaxian section of the Giant Panda National Park at an altitude of over 2,400 meters, ecological guardian Hu Tailun pointed to the bamboo and broad-leaved forests covering the mountains before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, due to natural and human factors, China's giant panda population was fragmented into multiple small populations, as if living on isolated \"islands,\" hindering their reproduction and survival. By the end of 2013, the number of wild giant pandas in the country was 1,864, divided into 33 local populations, of which 24 populations faced extinction risks due to the small number of giant pandas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the Giant Panda National Park was officially established. To improve the genetic exchange capacity of giant pandas, including the Yaxian section, the Sichuan section planned 10 giant panda ecological corridors such as Tuowushan, Nibashan, and Erlangshan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Sichuan section focuses on the important habitats of giant pandas and key ecological corridors, implementing ecological restoration of nearly 54 square kilometers, effectively protecting 64.8% of the country's wild giant pandas,\" said Chen Zongqian, deputy director of the Sichuan Forestry and Grassland Bureau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment on which they depend for survival has been improved and protected, and different populations of giant pandas can now \"visit\" each other again.\n",

      "Li Wansong, who has lived in Tongmu Village, Wuyishan, Fujian Province for generations, never expected that his three jobs could blend so well—tea garden owner, ecological forest ranger, and homestay owner. All of this is the result of changes brought about by the construction of Wuyishan National Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wuyishan National Park covers an area of 1,280 square kilometers, spanning Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, and is known for its rich biological resources and biodiversity aggregation. It is also the birthplace of the world's oolong tea and black tea. The tea industry is one of the pillar industries here, and Li Wansong has been operating a tea garden for more than 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In recent years, driven by economic interests, people often destroyed forests to plant tea, damaging the ecological environment on the mountains, reducing biodiversity, and weakening functions such as soil conservation and air purification,\" Li Wansong said. Since the establishment of the national park, the protection efforts have been continuously strengthened, and the phenomenon of destroying forests to plant tea has been curbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, \"protecting the ecological environment is protecting our homeland\" has become a consensus among the people of Wuyishan. After the establishment of the Wuyishan National Park, Li Wansong and the villagers became ecological forest rangers. \"Now, we use all-weather, all-round 'sky-earth' monitoring and management, with strong ecological protection capabilities,\" Li Wansong said.\n",

      "\n",
      "While protecting the beautiful ecology, the park actively promotes the unity of ecological protection, green development, and livelihood improvement, guiding tea farmers to build ecological tea gardens, and promoting the integration of tea culture, tea industry, and tea technology, so that the people can further enjoy the ecological dividends\n",

      "The controversy over the traffic accident involving Xiaomi's car and the \"false advertising\" issue regarding its front hood has continued to escalate. On the evening of May 15, Lei Jun, founder of Xiaomi Corporation (1810.HK), delivered an internal speech reviewing the impact of the Xiaomi car accident, the social responsibility that Xiaomi, as a large company, needs to bear, and the progress of Xiaomi's phone SoC chip HyperOS O1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some voices are full of expectations for Xiaomi's re-disclosure of the SoC chip, while others question the depth of Lei Jun's reflection. Over the past year, Xiaomi's stock price has risen from a low of HK$15.36 to a high of HK$59.45, and has recently fluctuated due to car business issues. Based on Xiaomi's diversified business support and Lei Jun's brand image, the secondary market has not experienced large-scale panic selling. As of the time of writing, Xiaomi's stock price is HK$51.05, up 1.79%.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you try to handle everything at once, you will fail in the most important things. Lei Jun once said that while he invests half of his energy in the car business, he also invests about one-third of his energy in the phone business, as the phone is Xiaomi's lifeline. However, when both the phone and car businesses face intense competition, the allocation of the helmsman's energy is particularly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its founding 15 years ago, Xiaomi has relied on the \"Eight Immortals\" in its early days, later external management teams, and a young talent pipeline cultivated internally. Lei Jun, as a symbol of the group's brand, has played a decisive role in all of these. To a certain extent, the Xiaomi brand has been directly linked to Lei Jun himself. However, as the competitive landscape of projects incubated within the group becomes increasingly fierce, Lei Jun, who has pledged to \"bet his entire fortune,\" also needs to seriously consider whether he needs to take credit for every success.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unexpected blow\n",
      "The accident that occurred on the Anhui DeShang Expressway on the evening of February 29 brought the high-profile marketing of Xiaomi's car to a halt. The official investigation results of the traffic accident have not yet been released, and Xiaomi's car has once again been embroiled in controversy over the false advertising of the carbon fiber front hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, one of the core selling points of the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra was the 42,000 yuan carbon fiber dual-channel front hood. The official propaganda endowed it with the halo of \"replicating the aerodynamic design of the New York prototype car,\" \"enhancing downforce,\" and \"optimizing heat dissipation.\" However, according to the actual measurements by car owners after delivery, the air outlet could not blow a piece of paper, and the internal structure was no different from an ordinary aluminum hood after disassembly, not connected to the brake cooling system, and did not produce the advertised downforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing the problem of functional reduction and inconsistent propaganda, some car owners initiated collective rights protection, demanding a refund and compensation. On May 7, Xiaomi Car officially issued an apology statement, admitting \"unclear information expression,\" and proposed a compensation plan: free replacement of the aluminum front hood for undelivered orders, and 20,000 points (approximately 2,000 yuan) for users who have taken delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this plan did not gain the recognition of the car owner group—the replacement requires re-queuing for more than 30 weeks, and the point compensation is only 4.7% of the optional fee, and does not cover the demand for a refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Xiang, director of the Digital Car International Cooperation Research Center of Vodafone, told First Financial that some car companies, in order to achieve propaganda effects, start promoting vehicle functions before the vehicle is actually produced, and the customer orders accepted are blind orders for cars. However, such cars in the research and production process have many uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of social events have also made Lei Jun slow down his marketing actions on social media. In the review speech on the 15th, Lei Jun said: At the end of March, an unexpected traffic accident shattered everything. The company was subjected to storm-like questioning, criticism, and accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one expected the impact of this accident to be so great, and the blow to Xiaomi to be so great,\" Lei Jun said. The public's expectations and demands for Xiaomi far exceed imagination. Xiaomi's current scale, influence, and social attention have reached a very high level. Society and the public require Xiaomi to bear the responsibility of a real industry leader, which is an unavoidable responsibility for Xiaomi.\n",
      "\n",
      "From safety measures to technological investment\n",
      "After the car accident, Lei Jun said that he and the group's management team and colleagues in the car department had held countless meetings, thinking about how to systematically solve the problem and how to put forward more convincing management and governance performance to respond to the public's higher requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lei Jun did not explicitly indicate specific solutions and response measures, but he summarized his expression as \"technology is the foundation.\" He said that Xiaomi proposed five years ago to invest more than 100 billion yuan in R&D costs over five years, and this year it is expected to invest more than 30 billion yuan. At the same time, Lei Jun disclosed to the outside world that Xiaomi's self-developed phone SoC chip HyperOS O1 will be released at the end of this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 16th, Lei Jun further spoke to sort out the history of Xiaomi's chip-making. He said that Xiaomi's chip research and development began in September 2014, and in February 2017, Xiaomi held its first chip launch conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Xiaomi established Pinecone Electronics and started the road of self-developed chips. After 28 months, Xiaomi completed the entire process from the project of Pengpai S1 to the production of chips, and launched Pengpai S1 to the outside world in 2017. Although it was only based on the 28nm process technology, Xiaomi Pengpai S1 still made Xiaomi the fourth mobile phone manufacturer after Apple, Samsung, and Huawei to independently develop chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, after S1, S2 did not come as scheduled, and the entire Xiaomi self-developed SoC chip information disclosure action has been stagnant until now. In March 2023, Xiaomi released the MIX FOLD folding screen phone, which first adopted the self-developed ISP (image processing chip) \"Pengpai C1\". The ISP is separated from the SoC and is independent on the motherboard. At that time, Lei Jun said that this is just a small step in Xiaomi's continuous exploration of professional imaging. Since the launch of Xiaomi's first chip, it has been seven years, and Xiaomi's chip-making journey has never stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Lei Jun emphasized the significance of chip-making to Xiaomi: many people think that making chips is a nine-death-and-one-living thing, but Xiaomi still insists on doing it. In his view, chips are the commanding heights of mobile phone technology, and Xiaomi must master core technologies. Xiaomi wants to compete in the mobile phone market and must make long-term investments in chip technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defending the phone market, charging into the car market\n",
      "Whether it is self-developed chips or investment in car safety, Xiaomi Group is currently facing multi-faceted pressure. Lei Jun, who holds multiple positions, is also facing the dual challenge of the red ocean of the mobile phone business and the early stage of the car business. The priority of planning and deployment, personal energy, and the balance of group resource allocation are Lei Jun's current urgent tasks.\n",

      "On the one hand, in the mobile phone market, according to Canalys data, driven by the dual effect of national subsidies and overall consumption recovery, the Chinese mainland smartphone market has shown a mild recovery, with shipments in the first quarter of 2025 increasing by 5% year-on-year to 70.9 million units. Among them, Xiaomi's shipments reached 13.3 million units, a year-on-year increase of 40%. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of products and channels, Xiaomi returned to the first place in the Chinese mainland smartphone market with a 19% market share, maintaining the domestic goal of increasing market share by at least 1% every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the international market, excluding the Chinese market shipments, Xiaomi's mobile phone overseas market shipments fell by about 8.7% year-on-year. Canalys chief analyst Zhu Jiayao said: \"The situation of smartphones in various regions is becoming more complicated. In regions such as India, Latin America, and the Middle East, which have shown strong growth momentum in the past year, there has been a significant decline, reflecting the saturation of replacement demand in the mass product segment. Most Android brands are actively adjusting their inventory levels in the first quarter to avoid affecting the launch of new machines and channel price systems. The European market, after a short-term recovery, has fallen again, and manufacturers are constrained by the high inventory of flagship machines at the end of last year and the disruption of the ecological design law to the future product lines of the mid-to-low-end segments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the domestic new energy vehicle market, although relevant departments have proposed to further strengthen market supervision and rectify illegal marketing chaos, the close combat has not ended, and the price war is continuing. According to the insurance data provided by Li Yanwei, an expert from the China Automobile Circulation Association, Xiaomi's car sales have declined for three consecutive weeks. Although Wang Hua, general manager of the public relations department of Xiaomi Group, said that the recent sales trend of Xiaomi cars should consider cyclical factors, whether it is mobile phones or cars, they are all at a critical stage where one person's strength cannot decide the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lei Jun, since Xiaomi officially announced the launch of the car business, his focus and energy have gradually shifted from mobile phones to cars. However, as Lei Jun said in his 2024 annual speech: Xiaomi SU7 only means that Xiaomi cars have finally squeezed into the game, but it is still far from real success, and Xiaomi cars' \"Long March\" has just begun.\n",

It is called ALPHA (Advanced Performance High-speed Access Asia Cable System), which will have at least 8 fiber pairs, each designed to carry a capacity of 18Tbps. The ALPHA project's memorandum of understanding was signed by Telin CEO Budi Satria Dharma Purba and KT Senior Vice President Joon Myung. The two companies stated that they aim to complete the project plan this year, such as determining the best route and next-generation technology for the system. The ALPHA cable system is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2027. Myung President said: \"KT's ALPHA cable construction is an important stepping stone to quickly meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud, big data, and AI traffic from enterprise customers in the fast-growing Asian region.\" He added that the company will also \"strengthen cooperation with like-minded global companies\" to continue expanding its influence in the Asian submarine cable market. Both KT and Telin believe that the explosive growth of internet traffic in the entire region is the main driving force behind the construction of new intra-Asian cables connecting East Asia and Southeast Asia, with the largest traffic currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. The companies cited 451 Research data, stating that the data center capacity in Malaysia, Indonesia, and India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10%-25% over the next five years. These countries share several advantages, including growing online businesses, locally customized content, and a young population structure.

      "The depth and breadth of industrial synergy significantly impact the quality and effectiveness of regional development, serving as a key area for promoting the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lian Yuming, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president of the Beijing International Urban Development Research Institute, suggested transforming the sub-center city into a bridgehead for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and building a demonstration zone for high-quality integrated development between Tongzhou District and the three northern counties to provide new space for industrial synergy among the three places.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The 14th Five-Year Plan period is a critical stage for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development strategy to bridge the past and the future, and breakthroughs should be sought in three 'new' areas to transform the Beijing sub-center city into a bridgehead for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,\" said Lian Yuming. First, accelerate the construction of a demonstration zone for high-quality integrated development between Tongzhou District and the three northern counties to provide new space for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Further leverage the locational advantages of the three northern counties, accelerate the construction of a seamless multi-level, multi-mode, and multi-standard comprehensive transportation system, and on the basis of forming a high-density commuting flow, further promote the interaction of business flows, information flows, capital flows, and technological flows to establish closer economic and social ties between the two places. More importantly, focus on building a business environment with the same processes, requirements, and standards, accelerate the transformation and docking of administrative information systems, establish a data sharing and exchange system and a data resource sharing catalog, and promote the coordinated development of \"Internet+government services\" and \"Internet+market supervision\" to achieve the integration of the business environment as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, promote the construction of a national-level green exchange facing the world to provide a new engine for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lian Yuming suggested that the sub-center city should take \"promoting the upgrading of the Beijing Green Exchange to a national-level green exchange facing the world\" as a handle, strengthen the functions of the carbon trading center, accelerate the development of green finance, innovate financial products, and support actions and technological research and development for peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. Use this to leverage the mutual flow of green funds, deep integration of green standards, and coordinated layout of green energy industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and explore the coordinated governance of \"dual carbon.\" On the one hand, take carbon reduction as the strategic direction, comprehensively promote pollution control, ecological protection, and climate change response in an integrated manner, and strengthen the synergistic effects of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. On the other hand, leverage the advantages of green energy concentration in Hebei and Inner Mongolia, strengthen the new energy industry through integrated layout, increase the intensity of new energy substitution, and promote the comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, promote the joint innovation of the three free trade zones to provide a new platform for industrial synergy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Lian Yuming said that the joint innovation of the three free trade zones in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei should at least play two major roles. First, establish a joint innovation mechanism for free trade zones based on \"policy sharing, innovation promotion, and platform co-construction\" to form a new platform for higher-quality integrated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and promote industrial synergy innovation through institutional integration innovation. Promote the mutual communication and learning of policies among the three free trade zones, strengthen the exchange and promotion of reform and innovation experience, and jointly launch a batch of innovative and leading free trade zone reform achievements. Second, expand the institutional mechanism reforms of the three free trade zones to the hinterland of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, fully leverage the advantages of broad hinterland and market, promote the marketization and internationalization of factor allocation, and form more competitive and influential industrial chains and supply chains in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\n",

It has fully leveraged the role of agricultural product wholesale markets and large supermarkets, ensuring smooth production and sales linkages and stocking up on goods in advance. Regions potentially affected by rain and snow have increased their stockpiling efforts to ensure smooth logistics. Second, it has carried out reserve releases and price-stabilizing sales, releasing reserves of small-packaged grain, oil, pork, and vegetables as needed based on market conditions, and implementing price-stabilizing sales of key consumer goods in a localized manner to guide prices to remain at reasonable levels. Third, it has ensured terminal supply, requiring key supermarkets to adjust their stock based on demand changes and ensure timely restocking, as well as rationally allocating delivery personnel to ensure the \"last mile\" of delivery.

      "A strong country must first strengthen agriculture, and a strong agriculture is essential for a strong country. Recently, the *Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Learning and Applying the Experience of the \"Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Improvement\" Project to Effectively Promote Rural Revitalization* were issued. This is the 12th Central No. 1 Document since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, once again sending a strong signal to prioritize agriculture and rural development, and pointing out the direction and practical path for promoting rural revitalization and accelerating the construction of an agricultural powerhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Farming is the foundation of the nation.\" Over the past year, despite the complex domestic and international situation, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we have overcome the severe impacts of multiple unfavorable factors, including natural disasters, achieving a \"20-year consecutive bumper harvest\" with grain production reaching a new historical high, rapid growth in farmers' incomes, and social stability in rural areas. This has provided strong support for economic recovery, the acceleration of building a new development pattern, and the promotion of high-quality development. The most arduous and demanding tasks in building a socialist modernized country still lie in rural areas. To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must persistently strengthen the agricultural foundation and promote rural revitalization. To do well in \"three rural issues\" work in the new era and on the new journey, we must take the promotion of rural revitalization as the main task, adhere to the people-centered development philosophy, fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, and fight a good battle for rural revitalization to create a new picture of beautiful, livable, and prosperous rural areas, thus better promoting Chinese-style modernization through the acceleration of agricultural and rural modernization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote rural revitalization, we must take the lead from learning and applying the experience of the \"Thousand and Ten Thousand Project.\" During his tenure in Zhejiang, General Secretary Xi Jinping personally planned and promoted the \"Thousand Villages Demonstration, Ten Thousand Villages Improvement\" project. After more than 20 years of sustained efforts, it not only profoundly changed the overall appearance of rural Zhejiang but also made pioneering explorations and set an example for promoting rural revitalization, which can be learned and referenced by all localities. We must learn and apply the development concepts, working methods, and mechanisms contained in the \"Thousand and Ten Thousand Project,\" starting from the practical problems that farmers are most concerned about, finding the entry points for rural revitalization, and taking local conditions into account to achieve real results, concentrating efforts to accomplish a number of tangible tasks for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote rural revitalization, we must firmly guard the two bottom lines of ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale poverty relapse. \"Having grain in hand means no worries in mind.\" To ensure national food security, we must persist in stabilizing the area and increasing yields, effectively mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for grain production and local governments' efforts to boost grain output, and solidly promoting the new round of grain production capacity enhancement action to ensure grain production remains above 1.3 trillion jin. We must also establish a diversified food supply system to further stabilize and secure the \"Chinese bowl.\" We must implement the monitoring and assistance mechanism to prevent poverty relapse, press down on the responsibilities of preventing poverty relapse, continuously strengthen industrial and employment assistance, increase support for key regions, improve development conditions, enhance \"blood-making\" capabilities, stimulate endogenous motivation, and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation to prevent large-scale poverty relapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote rural revitalization, we must focus on continuously strengthening the key tasks of improving the level of rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance. The countryside is not only the spatial carrier of agricultural production but also the homeland where the vast majority of farmers are born and raised. We must improve the level of rural industrial development, promote the integrated development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, and do a good job of \"local specialties.\" We must adhere to the principles of industrial revitalization, quality revitalization, and green revitalization, and accelerate the construction of a modern rural industrial system featuring the integration of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, as well as the coordination of production, processing, and sales, and the integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism. We must improve the level of rural construction, enhance the leading role of rural planning, adapt to the trend of rural population changes, optimize the layout of villages, industrial structure, and public service allocation, and coordinate new urbanization and rural revitalization. We must improve the level of rural governance, promote the role of Party building in rural revitalization, enrich rural culture, continuously promote rural customs reform, adhere to and develop the \"Fengqiao Experience\" in the new era, and build safe and harmonious rural areas. By coordinating the promotion of rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance, we can continuously create a good environment for people to live and work in peace, thus giving the vast majority of farmers a stronger sense of gain, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "To promote rural revitalization, science and technology are the sharp weapons, and reform is the magic key. We must strengthen the dual drive of science and technology and reform, optimize the strategic layout of agricultural scientific and technological innovation, increase the attack on key core technologies of seed sources, strengthen rural reform and innovation, and enhance the integrated effect of reform measures to add momentum and vitality to rural revitalization. \"A well-governed country depends on the wealth of its people,\" and increasing farmers' income is the central task of \"three rural issues\" work. We must implement the action to promote farmers' income growth, continuously strengthen rural industries that enrich the people, strengthen the role of industries in linking and supporting farmers, strengthen vocational skills training for rural migrant workers, promote multi-channel employment for rural labor forces, and broaden channels for income growth, so that farmers' pockets are increasingly full and their lives are increasingly better.\n",

Doing well in \"three rural issues\" work is a glorious mission and a heavy responsibility. Let us, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, aim at the goal of building an agricultural powerhouse, remain confident, work hard, and strive to implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee on \"three rural issues\" work with the spirit of nailing down the task, so that rural revitalization continues to achieve new results and steadily advance toward the goal of building an agricultural powerhouse.\n",

China will continue to provide the world with high-quality Chinese manufacturing and stable Chinese supply. Second, jointly build a smooth and efficient industrial and supply chain. Further strengthen global interconnection to make factors circulate more conveniently and be allocated effectively. China will continue to promote high-quality cooperation in jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative and strengthen innovation cooperation in intelligent manufacturing, digital economy, and other fields. Third, jointly build an open and inclusive industrial and supply chain. Clearly oppose protectionism and various forms of \"decoupling and breaking chains,\" while striving to promote the green and low-carbon transformation of industrial and supply chains. China will integrate more deeply into the global industrial and supply chain system and actively participate in international cooperation in the field of green development. Fourth, jointly build a mutually beneficial and win-win industrial and supply chain. Promote the establishment of a global industrial and supply chain system with broad participation of all countries, complementary advantages, and shared benefits. China will actively promote industrial and production capacity cooperation with various countries and drive developing countries to participate more deeply in the global value chain. It is hoped that business leaders from various countries will play an active role in promoting the stable operation of the global industrial and supply chain. China will provide more convenience and better protection for foreign enterprises to invest and do business in China.\n",

      "In 2021, we fully experienced the surging power of the digital wave. As the entire society accelerated its march toward digitalization, networking, and intelligence, the importance of building new-generation information infrastructure, represented by IPv6, became increasingly prominent. Over the past year, thanks to the strong guidance of policies and the concerted efforts of the entire industry, China made significant progress in the large-scale deployment of IPv6, with IPv6 traffic surging, continuous innovation in IPv6-based applications, and the accelerated construction of the \"IPv6+\" innovation system. This provided strong support for the construction of a cyber power and digital China, promoting the vigorous development of the digital economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Three-Year Plan Outlines the Blueprint for Large-Scale IPv6 Deployment**\n",
      "For China's IPv6 development, 2021 was a special year. In this year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially issued the *Three-Year Action Plan for Promoting IPv6 Traffic Growth (2021-2023)* (hereinafter referred to as the *Three-Year Action Plan*), which clearly outlined the key development tasks for the next three years. This marked the formal entry of China's IPv6 development into the \"traffic growth\" era after completing key stages such as network readiness and end-to-end connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large-scale deployment and application of IPv6 are an inevitable trend in the evolution and upgrading of the internet, an important direction for network technology innovation, and a key support for the construction of a cyber power. Since the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued the *Action Plan for Promoting the Large-Scale Deployment of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)* in 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has organized and carried out a series of special actions, including \"IPv6 Network Readiness,\" \"IPv6 End-to-End Connectivity,\" and \"IPv6 Traffic Growth.\" In July 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially issued the *Three-Year Action Plan*, promoting the development of the IPv6 industry to a new stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The *Three-Year Action Plan* focuses on the overall goal of promoting IPv6 traffic growth and sets quantitative targets from aspects such as the performance of network and application infrastructure services, the IPv6 concentration of major commercial internet applications, and the proportion of terminal devices supporting IPv6. For example, by the end of 2023, the proportion of IPv6 traffic in mobile networks will increase from 20% in 2021 to 50%, and the IPv6 concentration of the top 100 commercial internet applications in terms of user volume will increase from 40% in 2021 to 70%. Industry experts believe that the *Three-Year Action Plan* sets quantitative targets for the key and pain points of the IPv6 industry, which has important guiding significance for industrial development.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better promote the implementation of the *Three-Year Action Plan*, on August 25, 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology held a national deployment and promotion conference for the three-year special action to promote IPv6 traffic growth. The conference provided policy interpretation and deployment to the entire industry, with representatives from more than 50 industry enterprises and 31 provincial (autonomous region, municipality) communication management bureaus and departments in charge of industry and information technology attending the meeting. The conference gathered consensus and accelerated the large-scale deployment of IPv6.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the *Notice on Strengthening and Standardizing the Management of Related Matters in the 2400MHz, 5100MHz, and 5800MHz Frequency Bands*, including the IPv6 support status of home wireless routers in the wireless equipment type approval monitoring requirements, breaking through the \"last 100 meters\" of terminal transformation for IPv6 traffic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same month, the IPv6 standardization work also entered a new stage. On September 1, 2021, under the guidance of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the State Market Supervision Administration, the China Communications Standards Association took the lead in establishing the IPv6 Standards Working Group. Industry experts believe that the establishment of the IPv6 Standards Working Group will gather the strength of various parties in production, learning, research, and application, accelerate the progress of IPv6 standardization work at home and abroad, and has significant implications for promoting the development of IPv6 technology and industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth mentioning that in November 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially issued the *Development Plan for the Information and Communication Industry During the 14th Five-Year Plan Period*, clearly proposing that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, efforts should be made to enhance the end-to-end connectivity capability of IPv6, improve the performance and service level of IPv6 networks, and achieve dual growth in IPv6 user scale and business traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Industry Synergy Achieves Significant Results in IPv6 Traffic Growth**\n",
      "The release of the *Three-Year Action Plan* has boosted the confidence and enthusiasm of the industry to accelerate the \"traffic growth\" of IPv6. Under the strong guidance of policies, basic telecom enterprises, internet enterprises, CDN vendors, and terminal manufacturers have vigorously promoted the IPv6 upgrading and transformation of networks, businesses, and terminals, with the results of large-scale deployment becoming increasingly prominent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since July 2021, China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Broadcasting have further accelerated the pace of infrastructure transformation. On the basis of completing the IPv6 upgrading and transformation of 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband networks, they have continued to promote the upgrading and transformation of data centers, CDN, and cloud networks, and, in combination with the landing of \"dual gigabit\" and other businesses, accelerated the replacement of old broadband terminals, helping to promote the scale growth of IPv6 traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, internet enterprises and CDN enterprises such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and Wangsu Technology have continued to promote the transformation of cloud, IDC, CDN, and other basic infrastructure, and increased the support for related businesses for IPv6; enterprises such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Meituan, Qihoo 360, and NetEase have continued to carry out APP transformations to improve the IPv6 concentration of APP applications; terminal manufacturers such as Xiaomi, Huawei, and JXTD have increased the transformation of IPv6 for products on sale and in research and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the joint efforts of the industry, China has achieved significant results in IPv6 \"traffic growth.\" At the \"2021 China IPv6 Innovation and Development Conference\" held on October 11, 2021, Han Xia, the chief engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, announced to the industry that China's mobile network IPv6 traffic has grown from zero to a share of 22.87%, completing the annual target ahead of schedule and exceeding expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest data shows that by the end of 2021, the proportion of IPv6 traffic in China's mobile networks increased from 17.21% at the end of 2020 to 35.15%, and the proportion of IPv6 traffic in fixed networks increased from 4.3% at the end of 2020 to 9.38%, both achieving a doubling growth year-on-year and exceeding the predetermined targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Integration Empowers the Initial Formation of the \"IPv6+\" Innovation System**\n",
      "While accelerating the large-scale deployment of IPv6, IPv6 innovation has also gained momentum. The *Three-Year Action Plan* clearly requires the gradual and orderly promotion of \"IPv6+\" network and technological innovation. The *Development Plan for the Information and Communication Industry During the 14th Five-Year Plan Period* also clearly points out that it is necessary to support the pilot and large-scale application of \"IPv6+\" innovative technologies in key industries such as finance, energy, transportation, education, and government affairs, and enhance the support capability of IPv6 networks for the digital transformation and upgrading of industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the entire industry accelerated the construction of the \"IPv6+\" innovation system, and a series of results were implemented nationwide. At the \"IPv6+\" Innovation City Summit Forum held on September 10, the \"IPv6+\" Innovation City was established in Shanghai, which will build a new-generation information infrastructure system with high speed, mobility, ubiquity, and intelligence as its distinctive features by 2025; at the \"Sixth IPv6+\" Industry Forum held on September 27, SAIC Motor Corporation and China Telecom jointly released the *White Paper on IPv6+ Industrial Intelligent Cloud Network Technology*; in October, Wuhan took the lead in launching the large-scale deployment of IPv6 nationwide, accelerating the construction of the \"IPv6+\" Digital City.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accelerate the integration of IPv6 into various industries, in October 2021, the first \"Guanghua Cup\" Gigabit Optical Network Application Innovation Competition, guided by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, was officially launched, with a separate track set for \"IPv6+\" technology innovation applications. In November, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other departments carried out pilot work on the integrated application of IPv6 technology and innovation, accelerating the empowerment of IPv6 applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, \"IPv6+\" has accelerated its application in industries such as finance, education, medical care, and energy, promoting the digital transformation of various industries. For example, Guangdong Province actively explored the application of \"IPv6+\" in government extranets, setting a benchmark for provincial-level \"IPv6+\" government extranets; the State Grid Hebei Electric Power Company was the first to deploy \"IPv6+\" innovative technologies in its network, significantly improving the network's autonomous decision-making and intelligent capabilities; more than 90 internet systems and the core network 2.0 system of the China Construction Bank have completed IPv6 transformation and been put into operation, and innovatively used \"IPv6+\" technology to significantly improve network delivery capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the \"network foundation\" indispensable in the digital economy era, the large-scale deployment of IPv6 is of great significance. At present, China's IPv6 user and network scale ranks among the top in the world, and the IPv6 traffic and business carrying capacity have been significantly improved. With the full launch of the \"traffic growth\" era, China's IPv6 development will further accelerate, providing strong support for the digital transformation of various industries and injecting strong momentum into the construction of a cyber power and the development of the digital economy.\n",

The State Council Releases Another Capital Market Guidance Document to Strengthen Regulation, Prevent Risks, and Promote High-Quality Development of the Capital Market—CSRC Party Committee Secretary and Chairman Wu Qing Accepts an Exclusive Interview on Implementing the Third \"National Nine-Point Plan\" for the Capital Market**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the State Council issued the *Opinions on Strengthening Regulation, Preventing Risks, and Promoting High-Quality Development of the Capital Market*. This document, consisting of nine sections, is the third \"National Nine-Point Plan\" for the capital market. On December 12, Wu Qing, Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), accepted an exclusive interview with reporters on implementing these opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**After a 10-year gap, the State Council has once again issued a guidance document for the capital market.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How should we understand the significance of the release of these opinions?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The opinions issued by the State Council deeply implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the capital market and the deployment of the Central Financial Work Conference. Following the two \"National Nine-Point Plans\" issued in 2004 and 2014, this is the third time in 10 years that the State Council has issued a guidance document for the capital market, fully reflecting the high attention and sincere expectations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the previous two \"National Nine-Point Plans,\" this document has several key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it fully reflects the political nature and people-centered nature of the capital market. It emphasizes the need to uphold and strengthen the Party's overall leadership over capital market work, adhere to a value orientation centered on the people, and better protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it fully reflects the main line of strong regulation, risk prevention, and promoting high-quality development. We must adhere to stability as the tone, strengthen the foundation, and strictly regulate to better serve the overall situation of high-quality economic and social development through the high-quality development of the capital market itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, it fully reflects the goal-oriented and problem-oriented approach. In particular, it addresses the prominent issues exposed in the institutional mechanisms and regulatory enforcement since the stock market fluctuations in August last year, timely addresses shortcomings, strengthens weak areas, responds to investor concerns, and promotes the resolution of deep-seated contradictions in the capital market, accelerating the construction of a safe, standardized, transparent, open, vibrant, and resilient capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The opinions set progressive targets for the development of the capital market.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How should we understand the future development targets for the capital market proposed in the opinions?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to comprehensively advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization. The Central Financial Work Conference proposed the goal of accelerating the construction of a strong financial country. A strong capital market is a standard feature of a modern economy. Promoting the high-quality development of the capital market is conducive to promoting the high-level circulation of technology, industry, and capital, improving the modern industrial system, and promoting the development of new productive forces; it is conducive to enriching financial products and services, creating more opportunities for residents' property income; and it is also conducive to developing equity financing, optimizing the financing structure, and improving the modern financial system with Chinese characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"National Nine-Point Plan\" focuses on Chinese-style modernization as the center, anchors the goal of building a strong financial country, and proposes phased development targets for the capital market in the next five years, 2035, and the middle of this century. It outlines a development blueprint from aspects such as investor protection, the quality of listed companies, industry and institutional development, regulatory capabilities, and governance system construction. We understand that this series of development targets is systematic and comprehensive, as well as progressive. We must adhere to the direction of market-oriented and rule-of-law reforms without wavering, respect laws and rules, and implement them step by step with perseverance to turn the blueprint into reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The implementation of the opinions will form a \"1+N\" policy system.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How will the CSRC systematically promote the implementation of the various policy measures proposed in the opinions?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The new \"National Nine-Point Plan\" adheres to systematic thinking, combines short-term and long-term measures, and adopts comprehensive strategies. Together with the implementation arrangements organized by the CSRC in conjunction with relevant parties, it forms a \"1+N\" policy system. \"1\" refers to the opinions themselves, and \"N\" refers to several supporting institutional rules. Last month, we had already issued four supporting policy documents on strictly controlling the entry threshold for listing, strengthening the continuous supervision of listed companies, and other aspects. Today, we will also issue supporting policy documents on strengthening the supervision of delistings and solicit public opinions on six specific institutional rules. The exchanges will also solicit public opinions on a batch of self-disciplinary rules in parallel. Next, we will further study and formulate reform measures to promote the long-term development of the capital market based on in-depth research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main line of the \"1+N\" policy system is to strengthen regulation, prevent risks, and promote high-quality development. This is an organic whole that complements each other, and we must promote and implement it systematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of strengthening regulation, we will build a comprehensive, three-dimensional capital market regulatory system and fully implement the principle of \"sharp teeth and edges\" in regulation. The supervision of listed companies will focus on full-chain supervision and improving the investment value of listed companies, with continuous efforts in three aspects: strictly controlling the listing threshold, strictly supervising continuous operations, and strengthening the supervision of delistings. Institutional supervision will promote a return to the fundamentals, improve quality, further strengthen the responsibility of \"gatekeepers,\" guide securities, futures, and fund institutions to correct their business concepts, and improve their compliance levels, professional service capabilities, and core competitiveness. We will actively cultivate the concepts of rational investment, value investment, and long-term investment, as well as a healthy investment culture. Transaction supervision will promote fairness and efficiency, regulate the trading behavior of various entities and funds, severely crack down on illegal and irregular activities that disrupt the market, and maintain a fair, open, and just order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of risk prevention, we will propose a series of mechanism arrangements and policy measures from the aspects of maintaining stable market operations, preventing and resolving risks in key areas, improving the expectation management mechanism, and coordinating openness with security. In particular, we will enhance the inherent stability of the capital market, improve the risk monitoring and disposal mechanism, and focus on stabilizing confidence and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of promoting high-quality development, we will earnestly implement the requirements of the Central Financial Work Conference to do a good job in the five major tasks of finance, further improve the multi-level capital market system, enhance the adaptability and inclusiveness of the capital market system, promote capital formation, better serve innovation in new industries, new formats, and new technologies, and effectively promote the development of new productive forces. Currently, we are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the capital market reform, widely soliciting opinions and suggestions from all parties, studying and improving relevant institutional rules, and promoting the continuous deepening of important institutional reforms such as the stock issuance registration system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Forming a capital market governance system of co-construction, co-governance, and co-sharing.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: The high-quality development of the capital market cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of all parties. What arrangements does the opinion have in this regard?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** The capital market has many participants and complex operating mechanisms. In a good market ecosystem, institutional investors and individual investors coexist and develop together, long-term and short-term funds each find their place, issuers and investors help each other succeed, all market participants fulfill their responsibilities, and regulation and the market interact positively. This requires all relevant parties to jointly grasp the balance of various relationships such as investment and financing, primary and secondary markets, entry and exit, and on-exchange and off-exchange trading, forming an effective governance system of co-construction, co-governance, and co-sharing for the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"National Nine-Point Plan\" has made arrangements for many key aspects. For example, it promotes the entry of long-term funds into the market, emphasizing the development of equity public offering funds as the \"foundation,\" while also focusing on creating a policy environment that attracts, retains, and fosters development, promoting the entry of insurance funds, social security funds, and pension funds, and making classified deployments. Again, the opinions emphasize the rule of law, focusing on significantly increasing the cost of illegal and irregular activities in the capital market, and improving the three-dimensional accountability system of administrative, criminal, and civil law. We believe that as long as we persist in implementing these measures, the capital market will become more orderly. For example, the opinions have made requirements for deepening central-local and inter-departmental coordination and linkage. We will continue to strengthen coordination with all parties to promote the formation of a strong synergy for the high-quality development of the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Building a regulatory iron army that is politically strong, capable, and disciplined.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: The opinions have put forward requirements for strengthening the CSRC's own construction, and the CSRC has also issued relevant documents. What specific measures are there in this regard?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** To forge iron, one must be strong oneself. The new \"National Nine-Point Plan\" has put forward clear requirements for strengthening the construction of the regulatory team, and we have also made arrangements. We will focus more on strengthening political construction, continuously consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply promote comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and fully implement the requirements of strict regulation and management with the determination to turn the blade inward, driving the overall strictness of regulatory work through the overall strictness of our own construction. We will strengthen coordination and linkage with the disciplinary inspection and supervision team stationed at the CSRC, solidly promote the rectification of central inspections, focus on eliminating the soil conditions for corruption, and promote the \"not daring to, unable to, and unwilling to\" corruption in an integrated manner. For the prominent issues of the \"revolving door\" between politics and business and escape-style resignations that are of concern to all parties, we have already introduced more than 20 measures, taking comprehensive measures from the business and management ends, and we will further deepen the special governance in this regard, grasp it to the end, and not tolerate it. In short, we will strive to build a regulatory iron army that is politically strong, capable, and disciplined, providing a strong guarantee for strengthening regulation, preventing risks, and promoting the high-quality development of the capital market.\n",

      "On May 11, the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology's Performing Venue Design Branch successfully held the \"Chang'an Joy\" Architecture Observation and Discussion Conference at the lecture hall of the Northwest Institute of Architectural Design Co., Ltd. of China Architecture. This observation and discussion conference, centered around the Chang'an Joy - One Belt One Road Cultural and Art Center project, conducted an in-depth analysis of the project's architectural design, stage craftsmanship, stage machinery, acoustics design, and operational design. It was not only an academic feast but also a deep integration of culture and technology, providing valuable experience and inspiration for the future design and operation of performing venues. The leaders attending the meeting included: Vice Chairman of the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology, Wen Qinglin; Deputy Secretary-General, Ni Min; former Deputy Director of the Engineering Quality and Safety Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development; Chairman of the Performing Venue Design Branch, Wang Shuping; Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and General Manager of the Northwest Institute of Architectural Design Co., Ltd. of China Architecture, Peng Hao; National Engineering Survey and Design Master, Chief Architect of the Northwest Institute of Architectural Design Co., Ltd. of China Architecture, Zhao Yuanzhao; Director of the Shaanxi Office of the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology, Chang Xinping; and Chairman of the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology, Zhu Xinjun, who delivered a speech online. He stated that the content of this observation and discussion conference is a full-industry-chain, including construction, design, craftsmanship, machinery, and operation. At the establishment of the Performing Venue Design Branch on August 28, 2022, he proposed that the underutilization of performing venues in China is a relatively serious problem. To address this issue, the association organized relevant departments and professionals to conduct a series of investigations and surveys. The relevant survey reports are being written, and a thematic forum on this issue is being planned. It is hoped that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, policy recommendations can be made to the government, and the application of multi-functional venues should be given priority in the future construction of performing venues in China, so that the development of performing venues in China can be more scientific. Deputy Secretary-General Ni Min spoke on behalf of the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology. She pointed out that since the establishment of the Performing Venue Design Branch, it has always been committed to strengthening the cross-integration of the cultural tourism and performing arts industry with the architectural design industry. In the past two years, the branch has held a series of activities, deepening academic exchanges and cooperation within the industry. Facing the new situation, the branch focuses on the development of the industrial chain of planning, design, construction, equipment, and maintenance of performing buildings throughout the life cycle, with architectural design as the leading factor, building a \"four-in-one\" platform for experts in performing building design, performing venue craft design, performing equipment technology, and performing group creators, aiming to break through a batch of common key technologies, enhance independent innovation capabilities, strengthen technological integration and innovation and model innovation in the cultural field, and promote the mutual integration of culture and technology. She made several suggestions for the future work of the branch: First, in accordance with the requirements of high-quality development, continuously stimulate the innovation vitality of performing venues to meet the new expectations of the people for spiritual and cultural life. Second, cultivate and strengthen a group of backbone enterprises and professional scientific research talent teams with market competitiveness and industry influence, and promote the scientific and reasonable construction of the talent team throughout the life cycle and the entire industrial chain of performing venue building planning, design, construction, craftsmanship, and maintenance. Third, establish professional working groups based on various professional design institutes. Last year, the association successfully applied for the 2024 Ministry of Culture and Tourism Social Science Project \"24DY46 - Research on Strategies and Paths for Improving the Utilization Rate of Performing Venues,\" hoping to provide a channel for the industry to reflect its voice. Fourth, in the future, the branch should take venue construction as the core, plan and coordinate the construction of the cultural tourism ecological circle around performing venues, and become an important carrier for promoting the high-quality development of the cultural tourism industry. Chairman Wang Shuping pointed out in his speech that the main content of this activity is centered around the Chang'an Joy - One Belt One Road Cultural and Art Center project, focusing on the project's architectural design, stage craftsmanship, stage machinery, acoustics design, and operational design, which is a multi-faceted exchange of performing venue design. This is highly consistent with the purpose of the Performing Venue Design Branch, which is to promote cross-industry integration, jointly promote the scientific planning and design of domestic performing venues, optimize and integrate equipment craftsmanship, expand comprehensive use functions, and promote the high-quality integrated development of performing venue design and performing equipment. Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and General Manager of the Northwest Institute of Architectural Design Co., Ltd. of China Architecture, Peng Hao, pointed out in his speech that the world is currently undergoing unprecedented changes in a century, and a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is emerging. Cross-disciplinary and cross-industry integration and innovation are important ways for industrial upgrading and industry expansion. The Chang'an Joy - One Belt One Road Cultural Exchange Center project is a model of integrated innovation in performing venue projects by China Architecture Northwest Institute. The project is designed by Zhao Yuanzhao, a national engineering survey and design master and chief architect of China Architecture Northwest Institute, and is a comprehensive cultural and art center that fully integrates culture and art, leisure, commerce, and ecology. Vice Chairman of the China Association of Performing Arts Equipment Technology, Wen Qinglin, and Director of the Shaanxi Office, Chang Xinping, also delivered enthusiastic speeches. Master Zhao Yuanzhao gave a report titled \"Joy of Chang'an - Thoughts on Urban Order and Characteristics,\" which deeply discussed the synergistic relationship between urban development and architectural design, and how innovative design concepts can promote the continuous inheritance of culture and history. Master Zhao Yuanzhao proposed that architectural design is no longer just concerned with the function and aesthetics of a single building, but pays more attention to its role in the overall urban space. This design philosophy prompts architects to consider the relationship between new buildings and the surrounding environment when creating them, as well as how to reflect and strengthen the cultural characteristics of the city. He mentioned that modern architecture should reflect regional characteristics, and regional architecture should also be modernized. This concept has been embodied in many architectural projects in Xi'an. As a historical and cultural city, Xi'an should, through appropriate design and planning, bring new vitality and functions to the city without destroying the traditional appearance. The Chang'an Joy project is a comprehensive cultural and art center that integrates cultural and artistic, leisure, commercial, and ecological functions. The design inspiration comes from the traditional musical instrument \"Yun,\" and its abstract form is integrated into the architectural design, making the entire building complex present a unique cultural characteristic, aiming to become a new cultural landmark of Xi'an. The project has a total construction area of 143,000 square meters, including a 2,049-seat grand theater, a 1,500-seat concert hall, a 511-seat multi-functional hall, and a 650-seat cinema. These facilities not only meet the diverse cultural performance needs but also support various conferences and social activities, demonstrating its multi-functional design concept. In the design, Chang'an Joy utilizes modern architectural technology and materials while retaining the essence of traditional culture. The external design of the building particularly emphasizes harmony with the surrounding environment, using materials and colors that are coordinated with traditional architecture to enhance the cultural expression of the building. The insights and proposals in Master Zhao Yuanzhao's entire report provide valuable ideas for the future urban planning and architectural design, especially for cities with rich historical heritage, how to find a balance between protection and development, achieve new and old integration, and create living and cultural spaces that meet contemporary needs. Professor Li Guoji from Beijing University of Technology introduced the stage craftsmanship design, which includes a double-layer main lifting platform, side stage, and advanced lighting system, supporting complex stage background changes and dynamic effects, ensuring the visual and auditory impact of each performance. The stage lighting and sound systems use the latest technology, including LED screens and digital mixing consoles, enhancing the audio-visual effects of the performance. In addition, the mechanical equipment of the theater showcased a high degree of automation and mechanization, emphasizing safety, advanced technology, and intelligence. Han Jintao from Beijing Beite Saint-Di Technology Development Co., Ltd. analyzed how Chang'an Joy transformed from a standard theater into a stage show. He pointed out that after 2000, the construction of theaters in China achieved rapid development and gradually moved towards a more professional and refined direction. He particularly mentioned the innovation of outdoor real scene performances and non-standard theaters, such as the 360° rotating and tilting water stage of the Wuxi \"Taihu Show\" and the characteristics of the Xinjiang Grand Theater's \"Thousand Returns to the Western Regions.\" In the performance \"Boundless Chang'an,\" the theater achieved high flexibility in space utilization, showcasing a series of innovative stage technologies and visual effects, combining intangible cultural heritage elements with modern artistic expressions, demonstrating how Chinese theaters can enhance audience experience and promote the development of the cultural industry through technology and innovation. Song Yongmin, General Manager of Shanghai Zhang Kui Voice Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd., analyzed the sound design and sound quality of the 1,500-seat concert hall of Chang'an Joy. The design adopted an innovative island-style performance platform and surround-style audience seating, as well as acrylic sound reflection panels suspended from the ceiling, forming excellent sound field diffusion. The sound quality evaluation combined objective testing and subjective listening, and the results showed that the concert hall reached world-class standards in key indicators such as reverberation time and musical transparency. This not only verified the success of the design but also strengthened Chang'an Joy's position as a modern cultural landmark and an international humanities exchange platform. Ding Weizhou, Executive Director and General Manager of Xi'an Performing Arts Group Theater Management Co., Ltd., Chairman and General Manager of Xi'an Chang'an Joy Management Co., Ltd., shared the operation of Chang'an Joy - One Belt One Road Cultural and Art Center. Through full-city and full-media publicity coverage, the operation period promoted customer secondary transmission through a combination of self-media and new media. By introducing world-class orchestras and musicians, holding project promotion conferences, creative press conferences, theater open days, industry insider previews, and creating a 24-hour art life voice platform, new attractions were created. Cross-border linkage, integrating commercial genes of social interaction, humanities, art, and interaction, made the Chang'an Joy project an important cultural landmark in Xi'an and its surrounding areas, providing the public with rich artistic experiences and promoting the overall development of regional cultural commerce. Deputy Chief Architect of China Zhongyuan International Engineering Co., Ltd., Zhu Yile, shared European multi-purpose performing space cases. She focused on introducing several representative multi-functional performing venues and their design features. For example, the Rottweil City Multi-Functional Hall not only supports symphony performances but can also hold conferences and banquets. Its variable audience seating and adjustable range between the stage and audience area provide great flexibility. The Munich Isar Philharmonic and Lucerne Culture and Conference Center also demonstrate multi-functional uses, emphasizing the importance of sound adjustment. These venues, through innovative design and technological applications, not only meet the traditional cultural performance needs but also adapt to the diverse cultural and social activities of modern cities, showing the new direction of future performing space development. This observation and discussion conference organized four on-site observation and learning activities, enriching the actual experience and exchange interaction of the participants. The guests first visited the Xi'an International Football Center, learning about its modern design concept and\n",

      "On September 5, the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that since August, agricultural crops in the province have successively matured. Local agricultural and rural departments have made early plans and arrangements to ensure agricultural machinery services, seize favorable weather, and carry out autumn harvest and autumn sowing in an orderly manner, laying a solid foundation for achieving bumper grain production. By August 28, the province had completed the harvest of 68,300 hectares of various crops, accounting for one-eighth of the total sowing task, including 37,400 hectares of grain crops, 16,500 hectares of oil crops, and 14,300 hectares of vegetables. The province has also replanted 12,800 hectares of vegetables and forage crops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has made early plans and arrangements, layer by layer to press down the local responsibilities, to achieve as much sowing and replanting as possible, promote the implementation of production increase measures, and formulate guiding opinions such as the *Notice on Doing a Good Job in the Implementation of the 2023 Agricultural Pest Control and Prevention Project*, the *Action for Improving Grain and Oil Yield per Unit Area of New Agricultural Operation Subjects*, and *Scientific Use and Recovery of Plastic Mulch*. Focusing on improving the target of grain and oil yield per unit area, the department has implemented agricultural support policies, helped local areas implement key technical measures, and accelerated the pace of improving the quality and efficiency of grain, oil, and vegetable production.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the level of mechanized operations has been improved. Local agricultural and rural departments have focused on promoting high-efficiency and green agricultural machinery equipment and continuously improved the mechanization level of grain harvesting during the autumn harvest. By the end of August, a total of 3,564 harvesting machines had been deployed for autumn harvest work in various places. Strengthening scientific and technological guidance services, the department has continuously carried out the \"Three Teams\" service activities, strengthened technical guidance services, and fully implemented the stable grain supply action. Disaster prevention and mitigation work has been done well. The department has issued the *Notice on Establishing the \"Call and Wake-Up\" Mechanism for Agricultural Disaster Prevention*, the *Key Points for Flood Control and Drought Resistance Work in the Agricultural and Rural System in 2023*, and the *Urgent Notice on Launching the Daily Reporting System for Agricultural Disaster Situations*.

      "   **Rotating Lens Smartphones**\n",
      "   Since the rear cameras of most smartphones generally perform better than front-facing cameras, and users have a strong demand for selfies using front cameras, how can we equip front cameras with larger sensors within the limited space of a smartphone while controlling costs?\n",
      "   In September 2013, OPPO released a smartphone with a 206-degree freely rotating camera module—the OPPO N1. This phone had only one 13-megapixel rear camera, but by rotating the camera module, it could achieve selfie effects using the rear camera. As a result, this phone was quite popular among female consumers at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Smartphones with the Most Cameras**\n",
      "   The Nokia 9 PureView has five cameras, and the even distribution of flash and distance sensors visually makes many people mistakenly think it has seven cameras. All its cameras have the same specifications, unlike other multi-camera smartphone solutions. Each camera is equipped with a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/1.8 lens, with only two being color cameras and the other three being monochrome. When taking photos, the five cameras simultaneously capture images at different exposures, which are then merged into a high-quality photo. This solution was jointly developed by Nokia and Light, the manufacturer of the Light L16 camera, using Light’s Lux capacitive camera control chip to manage the five cameras. Theoretically, this shooting method can capture more details and colors. However, in actual use, it suffers from slow post-processing speeds and sometimes requires computer software to fully display the shooting effects, which is quite awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pop-up Camera Smartphones**\n",
      "   For a while, the mobile industry was fiercely debating whether to use notch screens or full screens. At this time, OPPO proposed a new solution—pop-up camera modules.\n",
      "   The FindX, released by OPPO in June 2018, is a full-screen phone with the distinctive feature of integrating the front and rear camera modules into one component, which is embedded in the body and mechanically rises and retracts. When not in use, the camera module is completely hidden inside the body, giving the FindX a truly full-screen display with ultra-narrow bezels on both the top and bottom. In the retracted state, the back of the FindX is also a seamless glass panel, smooth and elegant. This design is both minimalist and boldly innovative.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Card Camera Smartphones**\n",
      "   In 2013, Samsung boldly released a smartphone that resembled a card camera on the back but was indistinguishable from other phones on the front—the Galaxy S4 Zoom. Based on the Galaxy S4 mini, it introduced a feature unmatched by any other smartphone at the time: a 10x (24-240mm) optical image stabilization lens with a 1/2.33-inch, 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor. The 10x optical zoom lens, like a card camera, automatically extends when shooting, providing the satisfaction of holding a camera to take photos.\n",
      "   Although the Galaxy S4 Zoom was a seemingly reasonable and creative phone, due to the limitations of the Android system and smartphone hardware performance at the time, people did not achieve the dream of replacing traditional cameras with smartphone cameras. Later, Samsung also abandoned plans to release more such products, which was regrettable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Innovations in the Mobile Display Field**\n",
      "   **3D Naked-Eye Smartphones**\n",
      "   The Red camera brand created the first mainstream 4K digital camera, the Red One, and later shifted to developing 8K cameras with its \"Weapon\" series, gaining recognition from professionals. Today, it has become a major camera brand in Hollywood.\n",
      "   In 2018, it released a large and bulky smartphone, the RED Hydrogen One. This phone had high-end specifications at the time, featuring a naked-eye 3D holographic display, a large-capacity battery, a unique wavy bezel, and a modular expansion connector for professional camera accessories. Its back cover was also stylishly designed. The design inherited the aesthetic of Red’s cameras, standing out as both bulky and solid. However, the core selling point, the naked-eye 3D display, was criticized for its limited usable scenarios and lack of viewable content.\n",
      "\n",
      "   After the release of the RED Hydrogen One, the market’s lukewarm response forced Red to abandon further smartphone development and refocus on high-end imaging equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Projector Phones**\n",
      "   Smartphone screens are inherently limited in size. How can we freely enlarge the screen for a better experience and more conveniently share phone content with friends? In 2012, Samsung released the first smartphone with projection capabilities, the Galaxy Beam. This phone used Android 2.3 and had a projector on top that could project phone content with a brightness of 15 lumens and a maximum projection size of 50 inches.\n",
      "   In 2012, having such a portable mini projector was indeed appealing to many consumers. However, due to the inability to further reduce the size of the projector module, the phone’s thickness reached 12.5mm, and the 15-lumen brightness was almost unreadable in daylight, only usable in extremely dim environments. These limitations constrained the phone’s practicality and eventually led to its market elimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **E-Ink Screen Smartphones**\n",
      "   The YOTA dual-screen phone has two displays: a standard color screen on the front and an e-ink screen on the back, making it the world’s first dual-screen and e-ink screen phone. Originating from Russia, YOTA later collaborated with Chinese companies to develop the YOTA3 dual-screen phone.\n",
      "   The YOTA phone’s dual-screen design aimed to extend battery life. In scenarios like reading news, emails, or web pages, the more power-efficient e-ink screen could be used. Only for tasks like watching videos or browsing photos would the color screen be used.\n",
      "   However, this design faced controversy since the first generation of YOTA phones, and combined with non-flagship hardware, YOTA phones ultimately became niche products, failing to survive in China’s competitive smartphone market.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Dual-Screen Smartphones**\n",
      "   LG has made many attempts in exploring multi-screen phones. It once released the LG V50 ThinQ, a dual-screen phone with an external expandable screen forming a foldable-like design, which was popular among some gamers for its split-screen gaming setup.\n",
      "   Later, LG launched the LG Wing, featuring two built-in screens, one of which could rotate 90 degrees. Inspired by the rotating slide phones of the feature phone era, this design allowed different functions on the two screens. For example, when taking photos, the horizontal screen could be used for framing, while the vertical screen could adjust camera settings; when gaming, the horizontal screen displayed the game, and the vertical screen controlled it. However, many apps were not optimized for this design, leading to various malfunctions and even rendering the phone unusable, which was a major reason for its eventual discontinuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Innovations in Mobile Form Factors**\n",
      "   **Flexible Screen Smartwatches**\n",
      "   In 2019, Nubia unveiled its first \"smartwatch phone\" at the MWC in Barcelona—the Nubia α. Its core innovation was the use of flexible screen technology. Nubia believed that future phones would gradually merge with wearable devices, and the Nubia α was designed for this purpose. It featured a 4.01-inch narrow flexible OLED screen with a resolution of 960×192, worn like a bracelet on the wrist.\n",
      "   The Nubia α was Nubia’s exploration of future phone forms, but its unusual shape was incompatible with mainstream software, and its unfamiliar interaction and odd design deterred many consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Smartphones with Keyboards**\n",
      "   At the launch of the first iPhone, Jobs mocked traditional smartphones with built-in keyboards, ushering in an era of virtual keyboards replacing physical ones. However, BlackBerry, which was nearly defeated by iPhones and Android phones, continued to release smartphones with built-in keyboards.\n",
      "   The BlackBerry Passport stood out because it adopted a rare square screen with a full keyboard, making it look somewhat clumsy. Released in 2015, this phone failed to attract much consumer interest as the touchscreen era had already begun. Thus, it became the last phone with BlackBerry’s proprietary operating system. Afterward, BlackBerry switched to using Android.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **In Conclusion**\n",
      "   This review highlights some of the most representative \"innovative\" smartphones in mobile development history. Some of their design concepts remain unique and even regrettable today. Technology advances through countless explorations and trials, maturing only after numerous failures. Let us remember them and continue to witness the future of innovative smartphones.\n",

As of now, all 7 ongoing highway projects for this year have fully resumed work and production. Jilin Transportation has formulated and issued the \"Work Plan for Resumption of Work and Production of Provincial Highway Construction Projects\" and the \"Epidemic Prevention and Control Work Manual and Flowchart,\" and simultaneously established a special working leadership team to guide the resumption of work and production for highway projects throughout the entire process, in all aspects, and across the entire chain; it insists on daily scheduling of epidemic prevention and control and work resumption situations, and combines with the provincial department's special work resumption team and department-level leader responsibility mechanism to promptly resolve problems. Manpower is the prerequisite for resuming work and production. Jilin adopts \"point-to-point\" transportation for newly arrived personnel, implementing measures such as isolation observation, health monitoring, and nucleic acid testing according to local epidemic prevention and control requirements, allowing them to enter the site once these requirements are met; it organizes projects to contact material procurement channels inside and outside the province in advance, reasonably plan material transportation routes, and arrange for timely batch transportation of materials to the site to meet on-site construction needs. In addition, projects optimize construction organization arrangements, thoroughly explore existing on-site resource potential, accelerate the efficiency of new personnel and equipment entry, and adopt methods such as \"resting people but not machines\" to strive for more physical output in a short period; they strengthen safety inspections of machinery and equipment, power and fire hazard investigations, and risk and hidden danger investigations for tunnel excavation, key bridges, and high-fill deep-cut road sections, promptly addressing safety production loopholes and strictly preventing various accidents.\n",

      "Last night, my husband was installing a newly bought small cabinet in the kitchen, and I was helping him. My husband kept asking for a screwdriver one moment, then a wrench the next, making me run back and forth like a revolving lantern, constantly having to go to the toolbox on the balcony to search for them. Later, finding it troublesome, I simply spread out the toolbox at the kitchen entrance, letting my husband get things himself. Our kitten had never seen such a sight; it ran over and kept scurrying in and out of the toolbox, having a great time. Every time my husband took a tool, he had to first pick up the cat and move it aside. He also didn't forget to pet its head and play with it.\n",

      "My daughter was originally sitting at the kitchen entrance watching her dad install the cabinet, but after a short while, she pouted and ran off to play with her phone. Seeing my daughter looking quite aggrieved, I went over, patted her head, and asked, \"Why aren't you watching the fun anymore? Did your dad say something to you?\" My daughter put down her phone and complained, \"I was just curious and casually rummaged through the toolbox, but he accused me of making trouble.\" I comforted my daughter, \"Then let's just rest for a bit. It's as if anyone cares to watch him.\" My daughter, with an indignant look, pointed at the kitten and said, \"But it even got inside the box, and Dad kept praising how cute it was. Why can't I even touch it a little bit?\" I glanced at my husband, who was preoccupied with teasing the cat, then at the meowing kitten, and finally at my daughter, who had a stern expression. I said to myself, \"My dear child, from your mother's observation, this matter seems to have nothing to do with whether you touch the toolbox or not. Rather, it might have something to do with whether one knows how to act cute. Otherwise, why don't you try rummaging through your dad's toolbox while acting cute?\"\n",

Lam Pui-yan, Vice President of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, pointed out that although there are nearly 10,000 CMPs in Hong Kong, relatively few have served in the public healthcare system, and they are generally not very familiar with ward environments, methods of collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine, and clinical research.\n",

Students currently need to intern for several months in Chinese medicine hospitals in mainland China to gain clinical experience. \"We hope that in the future, students can intern in public hospital wards under the Hospital Authority, and that the curriculum will additionally include content on how Chinese and Western medicine collaborate, as well as relevant examination training, to enrich the clinical experience of the new generation of Chinese medicine students.\"\n",

Second, carry out reserve releases and affordable sales: releasing reserves of small-packaged grain, oil, pork, vegetables, etc., when necessary, according to market conditions; and launching affordable sales of important daily necessities adapted to local conditions, guiding prices to remain at reasonable levels. Third, ensure last-mile supply: requiring key supermarkets to promptly stock and display goods according to changes in demand; rationally allocate delivery personnel and ensure the smooth flow of the \"last mile\".

On the news front, February saw an asymmetric cut in LPR (Loan Prime Rate), with the 5-year LPR lowered by 25 basis points to 3.95%, a record high reduction, while the 1-year LPR remained unchanged at 3.45%. In response, CSC Financial stated that the policy combination of \"1-year unchanged + 5-year lowered\" may be intended to protect banks' net interest margins. Haitong Securities also pointed out that policymakers will comprehensively consider the balance between residents' debt burden and banks' profitability, and the market may anticipate the marketization of deposits. As of the third quarter of 2023, the net interest margin of commercial banks had fallen to 1.73%, indicating significant margin pressure. Although bank deposit rates were lowered again at the end of last year, considering the time lag in adjusting fixed deposit rates, coupled with the accelerating trend of deposits shifting towards fixed terms, banks still face considerable cost pressure on their liability side. Haitong Securities speculates that the central bank may continue to promote deposit interest rate reform to further reduce costs for financial institutions' liability side and alleviate net interest margin pressure.

      "[Hong Kong Daily News] President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the celebration of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.

Regarding the \"four hopes,\" he believes that the central government's expectations for the new government are more concrete than five years ago, and he is confident that these requirements will become the evaluation criteria for the central government's future assessment of the HKSAR government's work performance.\n",

He also pointed out that President Xi directly mentioned the well-being of citizens in terms of living conditions, housing, entrepreneurship, and education, and the President's requirement for the HKSAR government to \"break through difficulties and move forward\" must ensure the proper execution of these tasks, reflecting the President's importance placed on people's livelihoods.\n",

      "Whether in theory or practice, new-quality productivity is a thought outcome that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the scientific concept of new-quality productivity during his inspection in Heilongjiang, and later elaborated on it in multiple settings, particularly during a collective study session of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. In essence, the proposal of new-quality productivity is an innovation and development of Marx's theory of productive forces, a recent achievement of Xi's economic thought, a core concept with innovative significance in Chinese-style socialist political economy, a loud call at a crucial moment in advancing China's modernization, and a strategic deployment for the great cause of building a strong country and national rejuvenation. Whether in theory or practice, new-quality productivity is a thought outcome that can leverage the overall situation, drive the system, and determine the course of history, and further deepening its understanding requires grasping several angles and entry points.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be understood from the classic definition of productivity in Marxist political economy. From the perspective of classical Marxism, laborer, means of production, and object of labor constitute the three elements of productivity. The historical development and dialectical unfolding of the three elements of productivity embody the logic of new-quality productivity's development. From the practice of economic and technological development, it can be seen that the object of labor is related to new materials, new energy, etc., the means of production are related to informatization, artificial intelligence, high-end precision equipment, etc., and the laborer is related to professional talents and industrial teams in the era of informatization and intelligence, which can also be understood in conjunction with Lenin's discourses on labor productivity. The comprehensive penetration of science and technology into the elements of productivity and the improvement of labor productivity are the natural extension of the innovation of the elements of productivity. Marx regarded the means of production as the main marker of dividing the eras, discussing the differences between hand mills and steam engines, but in fact, both the object of labor and the laborer have qualitative determinations of the era. Lenin regarded labor productivity as the fundamental criterion for socialism to surpass capitalism, which actually incorporated science and technology into the productivity system. This enlightens us that every era has its new-quality productivity, and therefore, the concept of new-quality productivity is a concept with universal significance, which can be fully incorporated into the system of Marxist political economy and productivity theory, holding significant theoretical importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be understood from the historical process of theoretical innovation by our Party since the reform and opening up. In the most general sense, productivity theory is a theory of development. Since the reform and opening up, our Party has made a series of major innovative achievements in productivity theory through arduous theoretical and practical exploration. On the new journey of building a strong country and national rejuvenation, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the concept of new-quality productivity, achieving a major integration and synthesis of our Party's productivity theory. Placing new-quality productivity in this lineage, we can more deeply understand the historical significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be understood from the rapidly changing technological revolution. The technological revolution and the profound changes it brings are the main themes of today's era. General Secretary Xi Jinping's proposal of new-quality productivity is a high-level distillation and innovative development of historical experience, indicating that our Party's recognition of the technological revolution and its laws has reached a new height. New-quality productivity emphasizes \"new\" and \"quality,\" with productivity being a general theoretical connotation, and \"new\" and \"quality\" being era-specific requirements, forming an organic body of theoretical innovation, covering the general requirements for developing productivity and the special requirements for seizing the opportunities of the technological revolution, pointing out the bottlenecks and shortcomings in our country's modernization construction, and indicating the focus and path for solving the problems. This theoretical achievement of new-quality productivity enriches and perfects the value function of China's modernization, from which we can deeply feel the great power of the leader's thought, General Secretary Xi Jinping's theoretical courage and sense of mission, and the era significance of this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be understood from the global landscape of great power competition and Sino-US rivalry. Great power competition is a movement of force, with various forces interacting, waxing and waning, attracting and balancing, shaping the world landscape of a certain era, among which certain great power relations play a decisive role. Science and technology, especially high-tech, determine human destiny and the rise and fall of national fortunes, and are the real \"national priorities\" that must be investigated. In the early years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the focus was on nuclear technology, and we developed \"two bombs and one satellite\" on the basis of a blank slate. Now, it is information technology, artificial intelligence, new materials, new energy, life sciences, etc., and we are catching up, but there is still a long way to go. Great power competition is not just about scale, but more about quality; not just about total volume, but more about structure; not just about stocks, but more about increments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be understood from the dialectical movement of the contradiction between productivity and production relations. The dialectical body of productivity and production relations is the basic view of social movement in Marxism, and the two are in an eternal dialectical movement. Transforming production relations to liberate and develop productivity is the fundamental method of social transformation. We have been revolutionizing, reforming, developing, and modernizing, which is a major undertaking. For over 40 years, we have changed China's landscape, the face of the Chinese people, and the face of the Chinese nation, and have also changed the world's landscape, all thanks to the crucial move of reform and opening up. Nurturing and developing new-quality productivity should also rely on this crucial move. Now, there are still many institutional and structural obstacles that affect and restrict talent cultivation, scientific and technological innovation, and the development of new-quality productivity. People reflect on the drawbacks in talent cultivation models, scientific and technological management systems, innovative environments, achievement evaluation systems, intellectual property protection, and scientific and technological openness, with urgent demands.

      "It should be understood from the new journey of building a modernized strong country and achieving the second centenary goal. The on-schedule completion of the first centenary historic mission has provided a solid foundation and a new historical starting point for realizing the magnificent blueprint drawn at the 20th National Congress of the Party. The proposal of new-quality productivity provides a new logical starting point and theoretical support for this new journey. Our country has ranked as the world's second-largest economy for many years, but many industries are still at the low-end of the industrial chain, with the gap mainly in core competitiveness. Today's international competition is a competition of technology and talent, essentially a competition of high-quality productivity levels, with the strong prevailing in skills and the superior in quality. The proposal of new-quality productivity sounds the charge for the advance towards high-quality development.\n",

      "There are quite a few private traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics in Hong Kong, and the TCM practitioners have ample experience in outpatient clinics, but they have few opportunities to gain practical experience in wards. Lin Bei-yin, vice president of the Hong Kong Registered Chinese Physicians Association, pointed out that although there are nearly 10,000 TCM practitioners in Hong Kong, relatively few have served in the public healthcare system, and many are not familiar with the ward environment, collaborative methods between Chinese and Western medicine, and clinical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"TCM practitioners with hospital practical experience are relatively rare in Hong Kong,\" said Lin. While related talent can be introduced from the mainland as a temporary measure, in the long run, it is necessary to cultivate local talent in this field. \"We should leverage the expertise of senior TCM practitioners from the mainland to help train Hong Kong's TCM practitioners. The training should not only impart knowledge and skills but also provide practical experience in suitable environments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin indicated that the first step is to allow TCM practitioners to work in the wards of public hospitals for training and further studies. \"Reliance on face-to-face or book-based content alone cannot cultivate TCM practitioners with practical experience. After all, healthcare is a clinical practice, and it is difficult to master it solely through reading.\" She noted that there are three universities in Hong Kong offering full-time Bachelor of Chinese Medicine degrees, and currently, students need to intern in mainland Chinese hospitals for several months to gain clinical experience. \"In the future, we hope that students can intern in the wards of public hospitals under the Hospital Authority, and additionally, the curriculum can include content on how Chinese and Western medicine collaborate and related testing training, enriching the clinical experience of the next generation of TCM students.\"\n",

      "In July 2022, elevators in a certain community frequently broke down. After the homeowners submitted a repair application, the property management company informed them that due to the developer's failure to transfer the residential repair funds into the dedicated supervision account of the housing and construction department, the homeowners would have to pay for the elevator repairs themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 22 homeowners had paid the residential repair funds to the developer 10 years ago when they purchased their homes, why did they now have to pay for elevator repairs out of their own pockets? After multiple unsuccessful communications with the developer, the homeowners' rights protection hit a snag. Subsequently, Zhang Mou and others sought help at the Shouguang City People's Procuratorate's 12309 Procuratorial Service Center. After understanding the details, the receiving prosecutor Zhang Yongzhi suggested that Zhang Mou and others could sue in their personal capacity.\n",

      "After the court ruled in favor of the homeowners, the developer failed to fulfill the judgment for a long time. The Shouguang City People's Procuratorate continued to follow up and supervise, and jointly studied solutions with the court, housing and construction, and finance departments. Eventually, the court used the property quality guarantee money that the developer had previously paid into the finance bureau's account as the execution target and transferred it in a timely manner to the dedicated account for residential repair funds under the housing and construction department, supporting the parties' claims and avoiding the escalation of contradictions.\n",

      "\n",
      "In April 2023, the civil procuratorial department of the Shouguang City People's Procuratorate discovered a case clue during the performance of its duties, which led to a case of false litigation involving nearly one million yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, a certain trading company signed a steel purchase and sales contract with a certain construction company, stipulating that the trading company would supply steel of a specified brand. During the supply period, the construction company found that some of the steel brands did not match the contract terms and requested additional supplies. However, not only did Yang Mou, the person in charge of the trading company, fail to make up the 53 tons of steel, but he also, together with the project manager Liu Mou of the engineering project, fabricated false vouchers to increase the debt by 450,000 yuan and filed a lawsuit with the court in June 2022. The court's first-instance judgment ruled that the construction company pay more than 950,000 yuan in goods money, including the price of the 53 tons of steel that were not actually supplied. Since the construction company did not appeal, the judgment became effective and was enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This case may seem ordinary, but there are obvious contradictions between the delivery receipts submitted by the parties and the delivery records, especially the details of completing the additional supply while claiming to have performed it, which is very likely to involve false litigation,\" said Cao Weodong, the prosecutor handling the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through reviewing the case files and questioning key witnesses, the prosecutors verified the details of the delivery and receipt one by one and finally ascertained that Yang Mou had fabricated goods receipt vouchers to increase the goods money and filed a lawsuit with the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "False litigation not only damages the interests of enterprises but also erodes judicial credibility. Yang Mou's act of false litigation led to errors in the factual determination of the judgment, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and disrupting the judicial order. On May 5, 2023, the procuratorate initiated an appeal to the Weifang City People's Procuratorate. On August 2, the Weifang City People's Procuratorate submitted an appeal to the Weifang Intermediate People's Court. On November 24, the Weifang Intermediate People's Court instructed the Shouguang City Court to re-examine the case. On July 12, 2024, the Shouguang City Court delivered a re-examination judgment, reducing the amount by nearly 400,000 yuan compared to the original judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Yang Mou's and the trading company's acts of false litigation, the procuratorial organ simultaneously submitted a procuratorial suggestion to the court. Ultimately, the trading company was fined 100,000 yuan, and Yang Mou was detained for 15 days, effectively deterring litigation dishonesty.\n",

      "In 2024, while handling a case of concealing and concealing criminally obtained property, the prosecutors of the Shouguang City People's Procuratorate discovered that the criminal gang had built a \"slow recharge platform\" to attract consumers with low-price recharges and then transferred illegal funds obtained from telecommunication fraud, online gambling, and other activities in batches to user accounts. Finally, they converted the illicit funds into virtual currency, forming a complete \"black money to white\" chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with challenges such as anonymous operations and dispersed fund flow directions, the procuratorate relied on big data for source tracing and tracking and established a special case group with public security and financial regulatory departments. After several months, they locked down key evidence and successfully prosecuted 11 suspected criminals, recovering more than 400 million yuan in illicit funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Criminals exploit the psychology of the public's pursuit of benefits, 'whitening' illegal funds through phone and electricity bill recharges, and even extending to water bills, fuel cards, shopping cards, game coins, live streaming rewards, and other areas, causing immense harm,\" said Bu Xianhui, a prosecutor from the Economic Crime Procuratorial Department of the procuratorate.\n",

Nurture and expand new drivers of economic growth by vigorously promoting the development of new technologies, industries, models, and forms of business. Accelerate the development of the \"3+6\" novel industrial system, push for the scale and strength of integrated circuits, biomedicine, and artificial intelligence industries, and seize the opportunities in new tracks like digital economy and green low-carbon technologies. Implement the terminal-driven strategy with a focus on intelligent connected vehicles to gain an edge in high-quality development.

      "\n",
      "The meeting emphasized that the NHSA should deeply understand and grasp the rich connotations, essence, and practical requirements of President Xi's important speech. We must deeply recognize and grasp the major principles of reform. President Xi's speech strongly emphasizes that we must firmly grasp and consistently adhere to the major principle of adhering to innovation while maintaining stability in the process of reform. The NHSA should uphold the Party's comprehensive leadership, adhere to Marxism, adhere to socialism with Chinese characteristics, and adhere to people's democratic dictatorship, taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and the improvement of people's well-being as the starting point and goal. We must recognize that reform is directional and principled, resolutely carrying out what should be reformed while not reforming what should not be. We must also deeply recognize and grasp the scientific methods of reform. President Xi's speech clearly points out that reform is a systematic project that requires scientific methods and the handling of various relationships.

We should advance reforms in line with new trends in era development, new requirements in practical development, and new expectations of the people, ensuring that we protect the young by tilting medical insurance policies towards pediatrics and pediatric medications, accelerating the implementation of newborn care and epidural analgesia pricing items, promoting the upgrading and optimization of pediatric and obstetric services, and researching the perfection of the maternity insurance system to further enhance its role in supporting childbirth. We should care for the elderly by actively promoting the establishment of a long-term care insurance system, optimizing non-attendance services, and preparing to address the challenges of an aging society. We should guarantee medical security by expanding the family co-payment range of employee medical insurance personal accounts, gradually expanding the scope of direct settlement for outpatient chronic and special diseases across provinces, and providing more convenient services for outpatient chronic and special disease patients. We should support the introduction of more new and good medicines into the medical insurance catalog and crack down on fraudulent and deceptive insurance claims to protect the medical and life savings of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting emphasized the need to create a favorable reform atmosphere, effectively guiding public opinion and expectations while widely gathering consensus for reform, mobilizing all positive factors, and resonating with the main theme while spreading positive energy.

      "\n",
      "In the impoverished city of Lincang, Yunnan province, police services have undergone a significant transformation.  The city has consolidated individual police service windows into comprehensive one-stop shops within county-level administrative service centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Lincang had 186 individual police service windows staffed by 476 officers and civilian staff. Now, there are 138 comprehensive windows with an optimized staff of 380, offering 133 different services—a significant increase from the previous 32. This consolidation has led to a public satisfaction rate exceeding 98%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lincang Public Security Bureau has spearheaded this effort by moving various police services, including those related to visits, traffic, narcotics, security, internet security, and entry-exit administration, into these centralized centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure efficient service, Lincang implemented a \"full-service plus specialized\" dual-track system. At least 50% of the windows at county-level police service centers are designated as \"full-service,\" capable of handling a wide range of tasks. This allows for streamlined processing, with front-desk staff receiving applications and back-office staff handling approvals.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new system has significantly improved service speed. During summer vacation, Lincang's administrative service center saw a surge in demand, with police windows handling 150-200 cases daily, peaking at over 300.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officers like Chen Bin, who previously only handled entry-exit services, have adapted to the new comprehensive approach. \"We need to understand the business of each police department to serve the public efficiently,\" Chen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lincang PSB also emphasizes continuous training, job rotation, and strong accountability to ensure competent service. They have implemented systems like first-ask responsibility, service commitment, timely processing, and flexible document submission to enhance efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "A notable example of this streamlined service is newborn registration.  In Lincang, hospitals now upload birth information directly to the police system. Parents can then visit the administrative service center with their documents to complete registration, purchase medical insurance, and social security—all within 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Lincang is leveraging data sharing to facilitate cross-departmental collaboration for high-demand services like driver's license renewal and housing registration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city has also published a list of 50 high-frequency police services available for \"full online processing,\" aiming to create a seamless and efficient experience for citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure comprehensive coverage, Lincang police are collaborating with businesses, insurance companies, post offices, banks, and hospitals to extend service points into communities, eliminating the \"last mile\" obstacle to accessing police services.\n",

      "Yang Xianyi was an exceptionally rare talent in the academic world, and his two sisters were also extraordinary individuals. His elder sister, Yang Minru, was a specialist in Chinese classical literature, and his younger sister, Yang Jingru (later renamed Yang Yi), was also a renowned translator. They were born into a family of scholars. Their father, Yang Yuzhang, had received a traditional Chinese education in his early years and later studied economics at Waseda University in Japan after graduating. Upon returning to China, he served as the first president of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China. Relying on his abilities, he amassed a fortune worth millions, with the only regret being that he had no sons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Yang, his first wife, gave birth to eight children, but only two survived, both girls. Yang Yuzhang then took a second wife. In 1915, the second Madame Yang gave birth to a son, Yang Xianyi. The birth of this son was a great joy to the Yang family. After Yang Xianyi's birth, he was taken away and raised by the first Madame Yang, becoming the most beloved treasure of the household. Subsequently, the second Madame Yang gave birth to two more daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When their son was five years old, Yang Yuzhang suddenly fell ill and passed away at a young age, leaving behind a substantial fortune and three wives and six children (including a concubine and her daughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Yang Xianyi's mother was just 24 years old. She was determined to raise her three children well and provide them with a good education. Hailing from a humble background as the daughter of a poor rural family in Hebei, she had little opportunity for schooling and was not well-educated herself, having been sold to the Yang family as a concubine. She was young and beautiful, with a quick intellect, winning the genuine affection of Yang Yuzhang. Soon, she learned to read and write from her husband, whom she referred to as \"Master.\" The couple shared a deep bond and often read novels together, finding joy in their shared literary experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, their happy days lasted only six or seven years, as her husband suddenly left her. Overwhelmed with grief, she found solace in her three children. Because she had given birth to the family's only son, Yang Xianyi, she received a portion of the family's assets, including several thousand shares of stock. Their financial situation remained relatively comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Madame Yang was from a wealthy family, having received a private education. Her greatest pastime was playing mahjong. She had a kind temperament and treated the concubines and their children reasonably well. However, she believed that \"a woman's lack of talent is her virtue\" and showed no interest in the education of her two daughters. In contrast, Yang Xianyi's mother, having personally experienced the benefits of education, advocated for her two daughters to attend school. They both enrolled in the American Church school, Zhongxi Girls' School, one of the best women's schools in Tianjin at the time, as soon as they reached school age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi, the only boy in this wealthy family, became the \"little emperor\" of the household from the moment he was born. He lived a life of luxury, and even from a young age, he exhibited both intelligence and mischief. He once poured a bottle of French brandy his father was drinking into the goldfish bowl, finding amusement in watching the \"drunken fish\" tumble in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Madame Yang sincerely hoped that her precious son would grow up smoothly and arranged for him to be raised alongside the girls—she believed that girls were \"less precious\" and easier to raise. Yang Xianyi's two sisters were the daughters of the first Madame Yang, he was the third child, the concubine's daughter was fourth, and Yang Minru and Yang Jingru were fifth and sixth, respectively. As a result, Yang Xianyi's uncles' children teased him, calling him \"Yang San Miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi was the \"apple of everyone's eye\" in the family. His sister Yang Minru recalled, \"His toys were unlike those of ordinary people. There was one toy that we played with even after we grew up—a music box. It played a tune with several men and women dancing inside, all wearing clothes from the time of Louis XIV of France. That music box was very precious to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young master turned seven, the first Madame Yang, worried about kidnapping, hired a former Qing scholar, Mr. Wei Ruzhou, to teach him at home for safety reasons. Yang Xianyi began by studying the \"Three Character Classic\" and the \"Hundred Family Surnames,\" followed by the Four Books and Five Classics, the \"Collection of Tang and Song Poetry,\" and ancient prose, thus laying a solid foundation in Chinese classics. Despite his lack of effort, he always received praise from the old master. During this period, he also read many miscellaneous books.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until Yang Xianyi turned 13 that the first Madame Yang allowed him to attend a church school, Xinxue Academy, for secondary education.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chapter Two**\n",
      "\n",
      "At school, Yang Xianyi remained unfocused, spending more time playing than studying. The top student in his class worked diligently, but Yang Xianyi said, \"I didn't want to compete with him, so I always came in second.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi also enjoyed playing pranks. During a math exam, when a classmate couldn't solve some problems, Yang Xianyi passed him the answers on a slip of paper and even stuck one on the teacher's back without his knowledge. As the teacher walked around the classroom while proctoring the exam, the answers were seen by everyone... Eventually, the teacher discovered the notes and spoke to Yang Xianyi, who admitted his actions without hesitation. Instead of punishing him, the teacher praised him for his honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the old master, Wei Ruzhou, left the Yang household due to old age and frailty, Yang Xianyi's mother hired a private tutor to teach English and math to Yang Xianyi and his two sisters. Although the children excelled academically, their mother, eager for them to succeed, continued to employ private tutors, hoping to improve their performance even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sisters admired their brother immensely, feeling \"inferior\" in comparison. Yang Minru said, \"By the time he could recite the Thirteen Classics by heart, I hadn't even mastered the Four Books and Five Classics. In middle school, he was already contemplating writing a chapter novel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Jingru said, \"My brother is too clever. He wrote old-style poems at the age of seven and could compose couplets quickly. The teacher who taught us was named 'Xu Jiansheng.' When my brother saw his name, he immediately came up with three characters—'Quickly Execute' (\"Xu\" corresponds to \"Quickly,\" \"Jian\" to \"Execute,\" and \"Sheng\" to \"Gun\").\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Xu Jiansheng, the teacher whose name Yang Xianyi had matched with \"Quickly Execute,\" was not angry but rather pleased to have encountered such a talented student. It was also Xu who laid a solid foundation in English for the three siblings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xu Jiansheng was a native of Guangdong, graduating from the English literature department of Sun Yat-sen University. She married an orthopedic surgeon, Chi Shiqing. She got along very well with the Yang family. The children called her \"Teacher,\" their mother referred to her as \"Madame Chi,\" and later, their mother even asked the three children to call her \"Auntie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yang mansion was located on Garden Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, a large residence where they lived a wealthy and leisurely life, with servants taking care of their daily needs. The three siblings went to the movies every week, watching both Chinese and foreign films. Their mother was both strict and lenient with her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru was a premature baby and had poor health throughout her life. Doctors advised her mother to let her spend more time in nature, breathing fresh air. In the summer of 1931, their mother took the three siblings and their teacher, Xu Jiansheng, to Beijing's Xiangshan for a summer retreat. It was the first time the Yang siblings had left Tianjin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidentally, Yang Xianyi's cousin, Yang Canwu, and his classmate from Nankai Middle School, Luo Peilin, were also vacationing in Xiangshan. Luo Peilin came from a wealthy family in Tianjin and was a top student in their class. That year, he graduated from high school and was waiting for his university admission results. The group of young people became playmates, running around the mountains and singing, playing chess, and cards in the villas... Luo Peilin and Yang Minru got along well and left a good impression on each other. Everyone had a great time during their Xiangshan trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, within a few years, two of the uncles misused Yang Yuzhang's inheritance. The Yang family had to sell their house on Garden Street, the eldest sister got married, the second sister passed away, the concubine left with her daughter, and the large family dispersed. The first Madame Yang, Yang Xianyi's mother, and his siblings moved to Zhaofeng Road in the French concession, living in a rented house. The once-prosperous family gradually depleted its resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1934, Yang Xianyi graduated from middle school and was admitted to Yenching University. His outstanding academic performance allowed him to skip a grade and start from the second year of college. At this time, one of his middle school English teachers was taking a sabbatical in England and invited Yang Xianyi to accompany him to Oxford University. The first Madame Yang wanted him to stay and inherit the family business, but Yang Xianyi insisted on going, and his mother also supported his decision to pursue higher education abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Yang Minru was admitted to the Chinese department at Yenching University, studying under Gu Sui. In 1937, Yang Jingru graduated from middle school and was recommended to the Chinese department at Nankai University. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Nankai University was bombed, and the following year, she became a \"re-enrolling student\" at Southwest Associated University in Kunming.\n",
      "\n",
      "While studying at Yenching University, Yang Minru received a letter from Luo Peilin, who had graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, expressing his admiration for her. When Yang Minru returned to Tianjin for her vacation, she told her mother. Her mother immediately found out that Luo Peilin's parents had already arranged a marriage for him, and she strictly forbade her daughter from associating with him. After graduating from university, Yang Minru pursued graduate studies with her teacher, Gu Sui, for a year and a half. In the winter of 1939, she took her mother to Chongqing, the wartime capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, several hundred employees of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China traveled to Chongqing to establish a new branch. The bank manager, Pan, who had been a junior clerk when Yang Yuzhang was president, took good care of the Yang family. However, Yang Minru's mother was always strong-willed and insisted on paying all the necessary fees during their journey, refusing to accept any favors. Yang Minru could easily have secured a job at the Bank of China, but she wanted to be independent and support herself. Neither she nor her mother wanted to rely on connections to get a job at the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving in Chongqing, Yang Minru sought employment to support herself and her mother. As a graduate student in the Chinese department at Yenching University, she found a job teaching at Chongqing Nankai Middle School under the leadership of Principal Zhang Boling, which was known for its unique blend of strictness and vibrancy. Her salary was also slightly higher than at other schools. Yang Minru and her mother were very satisfied with the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luo Peilin, who had broken off his arranged marriage, also came to work in Chongqing. With her mother's consent, Yang Minru began corresponding with him, mainly through letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chapter Three**\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Jingru arrived in Kunming and enrolled at Southwest Associated University, she followed the advice of her Chinese professor, Shen Congwen, and transferred to the Foreign Languages department. Soon after, she was vigorously pursued by her senior classmate, Zhao Ruisheng, and they hastily got married. In her second year of studies, she discovered she was pregnant and had to drop out of school, leading a disheveled life. When her mother in Chongqing learned of this, she was furious and scolded her daughter severely. She agreed to take care of the baby but insisted that Yang Jingru complete her university education. Yang Jingru took a year off and then studied for two years at the Foreign Languages department of Chongqing Central University (now Nanjing University), earning her bachelor's degree from Southwest Associated University. Her mother's love set her free from the life of a housewife and enabled her to become a translator, eventually gaining fame with her translation of \"Wuthering Heights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since she began her career as a translator, Yang Jingru used the pen name Yang Yi as her new name. Her eldest daughter was named \"Xiao Yi,\" with the radical \"grass.\" A few years later, when Yang Yi was pregnant with her second child, her mother humorously suggested, \"Let's name the next child 'Xiao Ku' (Little Bitter)!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children adored their grandmother. Not only did she raise them, but she was also excellent at storytelling. She had read many books, including works by Bing Xin and Zhang Ziping, and she particularly enjoyed \"The Vicomte of Bragelonne\" by Alexandre Dumas. After reading, she would retell the stories to the children in her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Yuzhang passed away, he left each of his daughters 10,000 yuan as a dowry. Yang Minru told her mother about Luo Peilin's plans to start a business (which was actually underground work). \"I want to lend him my dowry,\" she said. To her surprise, her mother strongly supported her decision, contributing almost all of her own money, including Yang Jingru's dowry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after arriving in Chongqing, Yang Minru received a letter from Yang Xianyi in Oxford, England, which included a photo of a foreign girl. Her brother wrote that he was in love with a British classmate, describing her as \"a wonderful girl whom you would also like.\" However, Yang Xianyi was concerned about whether his mother would accept a foreign daughter-in-law and asked his sister to talk to their mother. After seeing the girl's photo, Yang Minru agreed that she was naturally beautiful. When she informed her mother, she was met with strong opposition. Her mother feared that her son might not return to China if he married a foreign wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru wrote back to her brother about their mother's stance, and Yang Xianyi replied that he would definitely come back. Only then did their mother reluctantly agree but insisted on living with her daughter after the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "After receiving his mother's approval, Yang Xianyi became engaged to his girlfriend, Dai Naidie, in England. When he graduated, he received two job offers, one from Harvard University in the United States and the other from Southwest Associated University. After discussing it with Dai Naidie, they decided to return to China and settle there. In 1940, with only 50 pounds in their pockets, they embarked on a long journey and finally arrived in Chongqing, where their mother and sister lived. The family was overjoyed to be reunited during the war (except for Yang Jingru, who was stranded in Kunming), and their mother even wept with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Yang Minru and her mother had seen Dai Naidie's photo. They were surprised to see her in person, as Dai Naidie was not only beautiful but also tall, even taller than Yang Xianyi. Their mother became worried, fearing that her son would appear inferior standing next to his fiancée... She chatted with her future daughter-in-law, with Yang Minru acting as a translator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi had to go to Kunming, but his mother insisted that he stay with her. Moreover, in the fall of 1940, Kunming was heavily bombed by the Japanese, and she forbade her son from going. Yang Xianyi and Dai Naidie accepted the offer from Chongqing Central University (now Nanjing University). However, they later discovered that they were assigned to the university's branch campus in the suburbs of Chongqing, where they couldn't stay together every day. Since they were not yet married, where would they live?\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mother had a solution. She decided to have them get married immediately and suggested combining the wedding with Yang Minru and Luo Peilin's ceremony, as they had been dating for several years. So, on February 16, 1941, the two couples held a joint wedding, known as a \"double wedding\" at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the wedding, their mother announced that they would not accept any gifts. Instead, friends and relatives sent numerous flower baskets to congratulate them. The certifying witnesses for Yang Xianyi and Dai Naidie's wedding were the president of Central University, Luo Jialun, while Yang Minru and Luo Peilin's wedding was certified by the principal of Nankai Middle School, Zhang Boling. Both were renowned figures in the academic world. The wedding was a grand affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mother was both happy and open-minded, advising the two couples, \"Let's do things the modern way. Let's bow instead of kowtow.\" When she said they didn't have to kowtow, everyone sighed in relief, considering how inconvenient it would have been for Dai Naidie to perform that tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi and Dai Naidie rented a house in the suburbs of Chongqing, while their mother lived in the teacher's dormitory at Tianjin Nankai Middle School, where Yang Minru resided. Before long, she was helping Yang Minru raise her children. Yang Minru's husband, Luo Peilin, later became a renowned expert in electronics and information science, as well as an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Their mother held him in high regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, Yang Yi and her husband also arrived in Chongqing, living in the teacher's dormitory at Central University, where Zhao Ruisheng taught. As the three families grew, they each had children, forming a large, thriving family that brought immense joy to their mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chapter Four**\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yang Xianyi and his siblings celebrated their mother's 90th birthday, she said to her three children, now all with white hair, \"I hope you all live to my age and see what the world becomes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This enlightened mother lived to the age of 95. In her later years, she continued to read, keep up with the news, and tell stories to her grandchildren, living a fulfilling and contented life. Her longevity genes were passed down to her three children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Xianyi passed away at the age of 94, earning the title \"the man who translated almost all of China\" from his fellow countrymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Minru lived to 102 years old. She was her mother's guardian angel, sharing her mother's hardships throughout her life and eventually caring for her in her final days. She dedicated her life to teaching and mentoring countless students, leaving behind numerous Chinese classical literature works and earning praise from her colleague Ye Jiaying as \"a centenarian who still possesses the heart of a child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yang Yi set a new record, living to 104 years old. Her daughter, Zhao Hong, said, \"My mother is remarkable; she made it to the Year of the Rabbit in the Gui Mao era.\" Yang Yi's autobiography, \"One Hundred Years, Many People, Many Things: The Oral Biography of Yang Yi,\" narrated by Yang Yi and compiled by Professor Yu Bin from Nanjing University, was originally scheduled for publication by Yilin Press in January 2023. However, it was unexpectedly released in November 2022, and Yang Yi had already read the proof copy, expressing her satisfaction. This gave her a sense of peace as she approached the end of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exceptional achievements of the three Yang siblings can be attributed to their remarkable mother.\n",

      "**Deeply Learning and Implementing Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, _Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in Thirty Lectures_, organized and compiled by the Publicity Department of the Central Committee, was published and distributed. The book, consisting of thirty topics, comprehensively, systematically, and profoundly interprets the significant meaning, scientific system, rich contents, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, serving as an essential auxiliary reading material for cadres and the masses to deeply understand this thought. This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Reading the chapters on comprehensive opening in this book, one cannot help but feel particularly proud of our Party's broad-mindedness and generosity in promoting the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. We also feel genuinely proud of the theoretical innovation's intellectual height, conceptual depth, and visionary breadth achieved by our Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1978, China has become increasingly open. Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, we have opened our doors to build, successfully achieving a great transformation from a closed or semi-closed state to all-round opening up. Facing the new journey, we must advance China's economy with a more open attitude to achieve high-quality development, thereby continuously meeting the people's growing needs for a better life. Currently, the international situation is undergoing profound changes, and the world economy and the global economic governance system are entering a period of adjustment. Protectionist undercurrents in Western developed countries are gradually surging, and these nations, originally expanding outward with their power, are showing inward tendencies. Conversely, emerging markets and developing countries are showing a trend of collective rise, with international power shifting towards \"East rising, West declining\" and \"South rising, North declining.\" At this time of uncertainty in the world, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the important strategic thought of forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. He considered the requirements of the times for forming this new pattern from the strategic height of human society's development and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Seizing the opportunity to expand opening up is not only a valuable experience in China's reform and development but also an inevitable strategic choice for the country's prosperity and development. Indeed, forming a higher-level opening pattern has become a critical decision affecting contemporary China's destiny and whether it can realize its dream of national rejuvenation. Comprehensive opening up is not optional but a vital tool for our Party to lead the Chinese people in keeping pace with the times and achieving the great cause of national rejuvenation amidst intense international competition. Looking around the world, comprehensive opening up has already become a sign of China's rapid development and thriving society, and it is the most appealing symbol of the Communist Party of China leading the new era of international relations. Comprehensive and high-level opening up is a distinctive feature of contemporary China and a prominent characteristic of our Party's governance in the new era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is the necessary driving force to accelerate the process of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Opening brings progress, and closure inevitably leads to backwardness. Human development is based on the improvement of productivity levels, which rely on the invention and improvement of technology. In turn, technological invention and improvement depend on the innovation and accumulation of human knowledge and experience. Different environments are more conducive to enhancing people's creative thinking, and the exchange and integration of different civilizations facilitate knowledge innovation and dissemination. Only through expanding interactions can human wisdom be stimulated, and human knowledge and technology be more widely spread. The Chinese nation has had a glorious past, which was an era of exchange and integration with its surroundings with a magnanimous attitude and broad mind. However, we also had dark periods, which were consequences of self-isolation and arrogance due to a closed-door policy. Opening up is a basic national policy, and it is also the key to the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the continuous achievements of socialist modernization construction. We should expand the scope and depth of opening up, engage in mutual exchange, learning, and integration with increasingly diverse cultures, broaden our experience and perspective in mutual exchanges, accelerate knowledge and skill transfer through mutual learning, and stimulate the emergence of new knowledge and technology through mutual integration. China's ancient inventions once benefited the world, and many scientific and technological achievements of modern developed countries have also promoted China's development. On the path to great rejuvenation, the Chinese nation should have an increasingly broad mind. Only by doing so can we stimulate our creativity and enhance our competitiveness in the interplay of different cultures and civilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is the necessary prerequisite for expanding the broad world stage for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only in the vast ocean can there be space for the growth of dragons; small streams, mud ponds, or shallow pools cannot nurture whales but only small fish and shrimp. Marxism teaches us that practice makes perfect, and action brings results. However, the size of the practice's stage often determines its breadth, and the size of the stage for doing business often determines the magnitude of the undertaking. Times create heroes, and heroes need larger stages. Struggling for national rejuvenation also requires more space for strivers. By expanding our opening up, we create broader spaces and stages for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Human history has developed in openness, and human civilization has also become richer through openness. China is an ancient civilization, but it declined in modern times due to its rulers' closed-door policy. Meanwhile, the world, with the discovery of the New Continent, transformed from isolated entities into a closely connected world, providing a stage for the rise of the Western world. Today, our opening up is not a return to the ancient Han and Tang strategies towards our surroundings but a genuine journey into the world in the tide of economic globalization, aiming to provide a broader stage for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by forming a new pattern of comprehensive opening up can we better coordinate the two markets of international and domestic, the two resources of international and domestic, and the two sets of rules of international and domestic. The new pattern of comprehensive opening up involves not only material aspects but also human resources. We should seek brilliant minds globally to serve our cause, coordinate international and domestic talent resources, stimulate more wisdom, and facilitate the implementation of the innovation-driven strategy. Today, achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation means returning to the center of the world stage, which transcends the ancient perspective of \"all under heaven\" and is a global world stage. Only by assuming greater responsibilities and playing larger roles on this global world stage can we truly achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is an inevitable choice for the Chinese nation's great rejuvenation to lead in building a community with a shared future for mankind. China's reform, opening up, and peaceful development are world-historical events in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, given that China has a population of one-fifth of the world. China's development has not only lifted the Chinese nation out of poverty and backwardness in modern times but also, due to its vast market with immense potential, brought opportunities for the world's development. On this planet, the complex and closely interconnected relationships resulting from economic globalization have created a situation where \"I am in you, and you are in me,\" forming a win-win scenario where prosperity is shared, and losses are mutual. However, some people are short-sighted, advocating \"free trade\" loudly when it benefits them but starting to build protectionist barriers when it becomes slightly disadvantageous. Facing this situation, China confidently persists in expanding opening up and strives to form a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. Promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and achieving win-win results requires expanding the breadth and depth of opening up. Our \"Belt and Road\" initiative aims to construct a new platform for international cooperation and interconnection, provide new impetus for common development, and advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The \"Belt and Road\" initiative originates from China but belongs to the world. It is an open platform that should transcend boundaries across different regions, civilizations, and stages of development. It is a path of cooperation and win-win results that should continuously extend and explore. As long as everyone clarifies the grand goal of interconnection and cooperation, strengthens policy coordination, aligns respective development strategies, adheres to consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, enhances policy communication, facility connection, trade facilitation, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds, relies on project-driven approaches, deepens pragmatic cooperation, and contributes to the development and prosperity of all countries, it will undoubtedly benefit people worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive opening up is the only way to demonstrate the vitality of socialism through the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Socialism became a reality in the tide of the international communist movement and can only develop and grow stronger in the surge of international trends. By implementing reform and opening up, we have opened the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and welcomed the bright prospect of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Only by further comprehensive opening up can we inject strong momentum into achieving this rejuvenation, enabling scientific socialism to thrive with vibrant life and energy in China. As China opens its doors wider, it not only promotes the continuous development and perfection of the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, raising high the great flag of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the world, demonstrating the realistic path for developing countries to modernize under the guidance of Marxism, but also provides new choices for those countries and nations that wish to accelerate development while maintaining their independence. It contributes Chinese wisdom and solutions to solving global issues.\n",

Among them, the first product will focus on the off-road field, with overall performance targeting the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, and is set to be launched this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to informed sources, BYD's new specialized customization brand will have a price positioning comparable to luxury car brands like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi (referred to as BBA), and will mainly feature multi-category, unique professional-grade electric vehicle models. The products' exterior design will be highly technological and unique. Additionally, the brand may introduce more new categories in the future, rather than being just a single off-road brand as previously rumored.\n",

      "It is understood that BYD's new specialized customization brand, known as the \"潮牌\" (trendy brand) in the outside world, has the internal code name \"F brand,\" and will position itself between BYD's existing \"仰望\" (aspiration) and \"腾势\" (rise) brands within the BYD system.

      "Researchers from the Petroleum Geophysical Exploration Technology Research Institute have been focusing on the Tarim Basin's exploration and development challenges, independently researching and developing geophysical exploration technologies for ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs. They have been emphasizing the standardization, normalization, and proceduralization of technical methods, providing strong support for efficient exploration and development in the Northwest Oilfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts have been made to strengthen foundational research, laying the groundwork for technological innovation. The ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are closely related to strike-slip fault geological activities, forming special fault-controlled storage bodies. Researchers have summarized a \"follow-the-vine\" technical approach of \"finding strike-slip faults first and then exploring oil and gas reservoirs.\" However, due to the deep burial of the reservoirs, the artificial seismic reflection signals returned to the surface are weak, and they are also affected by desert near-surface and deep high-speed igneous rock shielding, making signal \"decoding\" even more challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, researchers have established a series of three-dimensional seismic geological models of the strike-slip fault system and ultra-deep fault-controlled storage bodies in the Tarim Basin. They have conducted research on the mechanism of seismic wave propagation in complex fault-controlled storage bodies using three-dimensional numerical simulation and physical simulation methods, summarizing the laws of seismic wave propagation and seismic response characteristics in different structural styles of fault-controlled storage bodies. These foundational research results provide analytical bases for subsequent seismic deployment and interpretation, offering theoretical support for optimizing seismic data acquisition parameters and improving imaging accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the institute has promoted foundational rock physics research in the ultra-deep field, constructing high-level experimental platforms and key technologies. Targeting the ultra-high temperature and pressure underground environment of ultra-deep oil and gas reservoirs, they have built the industry's first ultra-high temperature and pressure rock physics comprehensive test platform for well depths up to 10,000 meters, advancing the rock physics experimental capabilities from 5,000 meters or shallower to 12,000 meters or deeper. This has driven the development of deep and ultra-deep rock physics experimental equipment and technologies in the domestic and international oil and gas fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on ultra-high temperature and pressure testing, researchers have clarified the temperature and pressure dependence of high-temperature, high-pressure ultrasonic sensors, forming sensor temperature and pressure correction techniques. They have revealed the high-temperature, high-pressure rock physical properties of carbonate rocks, the primary diagenetic minerals, and established rock physics models and interpretation recipes applicable to deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs. These have achieved practical applications in ultra-deep geological target confirmation and engineering \"sweet spot\" prediction, forming multiple original rock physics theories and results supporting \"deep earth engineering\" geophysical engineering integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seismic CT scanning imaging opens an underground high-definition window. Seismic processing and imaging technology are akin to performing a CT scan on the Earth, serving as crucial means to open an underground high-definition window. Addressing the issues of weak seismic reflection energy and low signal-to-noise ratio in ultra-deep seismic data, the institute has gradually formed a \"two-wide-one-long-one-small (wide azimuth, wide bandwidth, long array, small aperture)\" seismic acquisition technology, effectively weakening the signal shielding effect of shallow abnormal velocity bodies. This approach increases the effective seismic reflection information in the ultra-deep, acquiring high-quality data containing more azimuthal reflection information, significantly improving the recognition capability for complex structures, geological abnormalities, faults, lithology, and physical properties in the ultra-deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harsh desert surface conditions and complex underground structures result in the development of various interference waves with strong energy, significant near-surface absorption attenuation, and severe signal shielding and interference from special rock bodies. To tackle these challenges, researchers have innovatively formed a series of \"three-protect-one-measure (protect diffraction, protect amplitude, protect low-frequency weak signals, parameter testing to pre-stack time-shift imaging)\" processing technologies. These include weak signal protection denoising techniques for ultra-deep signals in desert surfaces, near-surface Q compensation technologies, amplitude and sub-wave consistency processing technologies, and layer-controlled data-driven inter-layer multiple wave pressure suppression technologies. These technologies enhance the energy and signal-to-noise ratio of effective seismic signals, expanding the effective bandwidth, and providing high-fidelity seismic data for subsequent imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fine imaging of ultra-deep target oil and gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, researchers have innovatively developed a series of full-azimuth angle-domain imaging and wide-frequency high-end reverse-time migration imaging techniques. Full-azimuth angle-domain imaging makes full use of wide-azimuth seismic information, performing imaging in the underground local angle domain to depict the contours and internal structures of fault-controlled storage bodies and dissolution fissure cavities from multiple dimensions. Based on the theory of analytic wavefield reverse-time migration imaging, they have innovatively developed anisotropic reverse-time migration imaging techniques, effectively weakening the impact of fracture non-uniformity. They have also developed wide-frequency Q compensation reverse-time migration imaging techniques, effectively compensating for the attenuation effect of effective signals during ultra-long-distance propagation. Additionally, they have established high-resolution least-squares reverse-time migration techniques for underground illumination compensation, improving imaging accuracy for steep-angle structures and ultra-deep small-scale abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive interpretation provides a safeguard for ensuring oil and gas breakthroughs. Researchers, targeting the characteristics of the Tarim Basin, have started with foundational geology and seismic theory research, conducting innovative technical research and applications. Addressing the challenges of conventional P-wave impedance inversion, such as insufficient resolution, poor inter-trace matching, and large computational volume, they have adopted a new semi-supervised learning model. They have innovatively developed an adaptive deep convolutional neural network wave impedance inversion method based on deep learning, resolving the difficulties in applying the original model. By combining model-driven and data-driven approaches, they have improved the interpretability of the seismic inversion process and results, achieving significant effects in describing small-scale pore collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the challenging issue of graded prediction of strike-slip faults in the ultra-deep, they have developed a machine-learning-based fault graded prediction technology and conducted tests, achieving good application effects. This technology establishes the relationship between seismic attributes and drilling well losses, improving the efficiency and accuracy of fracture detection and driving the development of fine-scale prediction technologies for strike-slip fault zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the challenge of quantitative characterization of ultra-deep fault-controlled storage bodies, they have innovatively developed a quantitative description technology for fault-controlled storage bodies based on frequency-varying attributes. This approach fully explores the frequency-domain differentiation features of storage bodies, achieving breakthrough progress in multi-scale pore prediction and correction, fracture scale quantification, and other aspects. They have also proposed the concept of a fracture scale indication factor (FSI), establishing a complete workflow from foundational theory, algorithm design, forward modeling, practical data application, to effect evaluation. This has formed a storage body connectivity evaluation analysis technical scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the shielding effect of the strong reflection from the top of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation on the lower fault-controlled storage bodies, they have optimized and innovated the strong reflection separation technology of matching tracking. This significantly reduces the interference of strong reflections on the description of deep fault-controlled storage bodies, creating more favorable conditions for the quantitative description of storage bodies. Currently, this technology has been integrated into the latest version of the NEWS software and has become an essential step in the quantitative description of almost all fault-controlled storage bodies in the Shunbei area, effectively improving the exploration success rate and economic benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, geophysical technology has evolved from two-dimensional exploration to three-dimensional, four-dimensional, and five-dimensional exploration, supporting the discovery of various oil and gas reservoirs in the Northwest Oilfield, including structural oil and gas reservoirs in the Triassic of Tarim, potential mountain-type oil and gas reservoirs in Yajia, karst fissure-cave-type oil fields in the Ordovician of Tarim, and fault-controlled fracture-cave-type oil and gas reservoirs in Shunbei. The exploration depth has extended from 4,200 meters to 7,900 meters, effectively driving the discovery and increased production of multiple types of oil and gas reservoirs in the Northwest Oilfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, the institute will continue to focus on the geological targets of Tarim Basin's cave storage body structures, small fissure clusters, secondary fault zones, and the spatial structure, filling types, and fault-storage relationships of ultra-deep fault-controlled storage bodies in Shunbei. This will assist the Northwest Oilfield in achieving high-quality exploration and development. (Author's unit: Petroleum Geophysical Exploration Technology Research Institute)\n",

By focusing on market demand and addressing industry development shortcomings, Tianmen has made efforts to build the entire vegetable industry chain, leading to industry upgrades and increased farmer income. Following the development strategy of \"buying nationally and selling nationally,\" and emphasizing the two core functions of \"centralization\" and \"dispersal,\" Tianmen is accelerating its efforts to become a vegetable distribution base in central China.\n",

      "In the autumn, Duobao Town is filled with green. Rows of robust radish seedlings make the fields vibrant and full of life. Duobao Town is the township with the largest vegetable planting area in Tianmen, among which, the planting area of white radishes reaches 100,000 mu (approximately 6,667 hectares), with an output value exceeding 400 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the town's total agricultural output value.\n",

      "Watering, thinning, fertilizing, weeding... During the autumn planting season, at the vegetable planting base of Hubei Minghe Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. in Dazhong New Village, Duobao Town, hundreds of workers are busy in the fields every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is a leading vegetable industry enterprise in Tianmen, with a self-cultivated vegetable area of over 8,000 mu (approximately 533 hectares) and a contracted planting area of more than 20,000 mu (approximately 1,333 hectares).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, we could hardly imagine such a scale,\" said Wu Hanping, the company's chairman. He started planting vegetables in 2012, and at that time, with manual labor as the main force, the mechanization level was low, and 300 mu (approximately 20 hectares) was the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, Duobao Town was mainly focused on planting cotton, wheat, soybeans, etc., while vegetables were only planted on a small scale by individual households. The low yield, poor appearance, and limited market access plagued the vegetable industry. Wu Hanping and other large-scale farmers began to frequently travel to Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, and other places to learn and bring back advanced vegetable planting concepts and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, we could only buy vegetable seedlings from other places at high prices, sometimes up to 1 or 1.5 yuan per seedling,\" said Wu Hanping. In 2017, the company decided to build its own seedling greenhouses. At that time, solar greenhouses were popular, but Wu Hanping insisted on building connected greenhouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar greenhouses can only be used for a few months in autumn and winter, while connected greenhouses allow for temperature and humidity control, enabling year-round seedling cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the connected greenhouse seedling facility of Minghe Company, journalists saw modern facilities such as wet curtain cooling, automatic irrigation, water-fertilizer integration, and heating and supplemental lighting, giving a strong sense of technological advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, with the rise of facility agriculture and the progress of agricultural mechanization, the vegetable industry in Duobao has rapidly expanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, radish planting relied on manual seed sowing, and one person could only sow one mu (approximately 0.07 hectares) of land per day. Later, seed sowing machines became widely used, with one machine capable of completing 100 mu (approximately 6.67 hectares) per day. Now, except for weeding and harvesting, the planting process is basically fully mechanized, with an average annual yield of over 8,000 jin (approximately 800 kg) per mu in normal years.\n",

      "Ganlu Village is a well-known vegetable village. According to the village secretary, Wen Yuangun, the village has a vegetable planting area of over 3,000 mu (approximately 200 hectares), radiating to over 10,000 mu (approximately 667 hectares) in the surrounding area. In the village, large-scale farmers often have annual incomes exceeding one million yuan, while ordinary villagers can earn over 100,000 yuan per year through land rental fees and working in cooperatives.\n",

      "Currently, the vegetable planting area in Duobao Town stabilizes at around 120,000 mu (approximately 8,000 hectares), with varieties developing to include peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and over 30 other types.

      "No matter how good the quality of agricultural products is, if market channels are not smooth, they can only rot in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days, due to logistics and information bottlenecks, the sales radius of Duobao radishes was limited to the surrounding areas of Tianmen. Wu Hanping shared his experience: \"When I called to inquire about prices at distant wholesale markets, the price was over 1 yuan per jin, but by the time the radishes arrived, the price had dropped to a few mao (1/10 of a yuan).\" From initially sending people to major markets to inquire about prices to now being able to browse national market price tables online, both information and logistics bottlenecks have been resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with the smoothing of information and logistics, the whole country has become one big market, and competition has intensified. To sell radishes far and well, stable quality is the top priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minghe Company has implemented the \"three increases and three reductions\" healthy cultivation technology for vegetables, which includes reducing fertilizer, pesticides, and labor, while increasing production, income, and efficiency. This has led to a 5% reduction in the use of fertilizer and pesticides in the base, a decrease of over 13% in labor per mu on average, and an increase in production of over 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innovation of sales concepts is equally important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Duobao radishes were still sold with dirt on them. The vegetables were loaded directly from the fields onto trucks without classification or grading, not to mention packaging. Buyers had to spend time, effort, and resources on sorting and grading, making the cost much higher than that of other established suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the segmentation of the market consumer group, agricultural products must be strictly graded according to standards for sales, creating a price gap to make them more attractive to buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, after Duobao radishes are listed, they are divided into four grades: premium, general, small radishes, and substandard, based on size, weight, appearance, etc. The price difference between premium and general-quality radishes can exceed 0.3 yuan per jin. \"The sorted premium radishes not only look good but also have value,\" said Wu Hanping. \"They are now being sold individually as part of vegetable gift boxes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Duobao vegetables have successfully entered ingredient supply chain platforms such as Wangjiahuuan, Qian Dama, and Duoduo Maicai, directly supplying thousands of households across the country.\n",

      "\"These are the ones we planted in Shaanxi,\" revealed Wu Hanping. Due to the selfless aid during the pandemic, last year, Wu Hanping was invited to visit Shaanxi. The local government has repeatedly invited them to develop agricultural planting there and help local farmers become wealthy. After repeated investigations and experiments, they have now rented 400 mu (approximately 26.7 hectares) of land in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, for vegetable planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to geographical differences, vegetable planting in Shaanxi can start in June and July, with the harvest period overlapping with that of Tianmen.

(hereinafter referred to as the Heyuan Steel Structure Manufacturing Base), has been issued the \"Joint Acceptance Opinion Letter upon Completion\" and \"Immovable Property Certificate\" by the Housing and Construction Department of Yuancheng District and the Heyuan Municipal Immovable Property Registration Center. This marks the first industrial project in Heyuan to implement the \"issue certificate upon completion\" policy, demonstrating the \"Shenzhen speed\" of the co-construction projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Heyuan Steel Structure Manufacturing Base project started production on April 29 this year in the Low-Carbon Industrial Park of Yuancheng District, Heyuan. With a total investment of 1.8 billion yuan and a total construction area of 400,000 square meters, the project can produce a full range of architectural and bridge steel structure components. It aims to establish a national-level demonstration base for steel structure assembly and a national-level intelligent manufacturing demonstration base, with the goal of becoming the largest steel structure manufacturing base in South China with the highest level of automation, informatization, and intelligence.\n",

      "It is understood that Yuancheng District focused on key nodes such as project start-up, completion, and trial production. They optimized and integrated multiple matters involving various departments and fields, planning a series of reforms for efficient full-process service mechanisms for industrial projects in Yuancheng District, including \"start construction upon land allocation,\" \"trial production upon preliminary inspection,\" and \"issue certificate upon completion.\" This reform presents the characteristics of \"reduction, integration, and convenience,\" significantly enhancing the local business environment. For instance, the \"start construction upon land allocation\" policy compresses the land supply cycle for industrial projects from approximately 8 months to 4 months. The \"trial production upon preliminary inspection\" advances the company's production time by about 3 months. The \"issue certificate upon completion\" policy saves at least 10 days for companies from applying for final inspection to obtaining the immovable property right certificate.\n",

On-site, young artists were immersed in instrument playing and physical performances created after staying in rural areas for several days. Citizens were excited to get up close and personal with natural experiences such as peeling water caltrops, pickling vegetables, and playing bamboo music. Everyone experienced the connection between humans and nature, art and rural life in unique ways.\n",

      "For He Lin She, a public welfare institution, supporting young artists to reside in villages and create improvisationally is the soul of their organization and the theme around which all their projects are developed. In 2014, He Lin She launched the Nature Art Festival, inviting experts from various fields such as art, sociology, and design planning to discuss how to improve the relationship between humans and nature, and between art and rural life. This year, He Lin She initiated the second Nature Art Festival, taking a significant step forward. Not only was participation expanded to a national range, but they also launched a rural residency program for artists, supporting them to stay in rural areas for a period of time, sparking inspiration for improvised creations, and truly integrating art and rural life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first rural residency was held in Chuo Dongshan Village, Kunshan. Three young artists who applied and received support came to the village. Chen Zhipeng, a natural artist who advocates for natural music and perception of natural art, is the initiator of natural music. Zhou Wewei, the second artist, is a sound explorer, natural musician, and also studies calligraphy. The third artist, Fang Shenglan, is a physical narrative artist. During this residency, the team conducted research and learning on the local natural scenery, root culture, and traditional music. They perceived the interaction between the current environment and people, and created improvisationally on-site multiple times. The artists visited local writer Zhou Gang, listening to the old man tell the history of Chuo Dongshan Village, the local sage Gu Oying's Yu Shan Ya Ji, and the rise and fall of Kunqu opera and puppet shows. The three artists followed the locals in the morning to inspect the fields, exchanged with elderly locals, collected recordings, and sat on the side of the street to create improvisationally. They explored and dug into local culture from different angles, while integrating their creations into daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exchanging and improvising in different places forms a different environmental atmosphere, which, in our opinion, is also a natural state,\" said the artists. After several days of sedimentation, a jointly created piece, \"Source·Sound Kunshan,\" was born. At the opening ceremony of the second Nature Art Festival held recently, nearly a hundred spectators watched the performance up close. \"These artists led us, the on-site audience, to experience another interpretation of natural art through instrument playing and physical performance, which was truly a special experience,\" said an audience member to the reporter.\n",

      "Academic heavyweights sit and discuss, jointly discussing art practice and rural development\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nature Art Festival not only features artistic performances but also intellectual collisions. At the opening forum, guests and hosts sat around three large tables and discussed a topic related to nature and art. \"The current development of natural art in China should return more to rural society,\" \"Traditional handicrafts are an art form that can prompt people to understand nature,\" \"Focusing on nature does not equate to rejecting modern civilization\"... Everyone wrote down their thoughts on the large paper on the table, allowing various inspirations to collide and spark unexpected viewpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Youth Daily reporter learned that before the opening ceremony, the Nature Art Festival had already organized a preliminary forum. Members of the festival's academic committee, resident artists, representatives of the institutions in this year's residency, and representatives of institutions that may become future residencies gathered to sit and discuss. They shared various cases of art practice in rural areas and experiences in community transformation, and engaged in a dialogue about the relationship between art practice and contemporary rural development, delving into community building.\n",

      "The academic committee members of the Nature Art Festival are all heavyweights. Teacher Zhang Lanying is the director of the Liang Qiming Rural Construction Center in Beijing and the executive vice president of the Rural Construction College at Southwest University. She has extremely rich rural construction experience and has visited multiple countries. In her view, artists who enter rural areas to create have their own dreams, and rural residents also have their own dreams. A balance must be found between the two.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first was the Bamboo·Music Natural Instrument Workshop, led by natural music mentor Chen Zhipeng, who specially came from Dali, Yunnan. He taught everyone how to make a simple instrument by sawing bamboo and spontaneously led a small musical performance. Due to the overwhelming turnout, an additional workshop was temporarily added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rural Art Workshop was led by the popular Wu Yun, who read He Lin She's original picture book \"Pickling Vegetables\" to the children, introducing them to the customs and traditions of the Jiangzhe region. Natural plant expert Qiuqiu taught the children how to pickle vegetables, which was incredibly fresh for kids who grew up in the city. Each person selected their favorite fresh vegetables, rubbed salt together, filled bottles, and happily took their homemade pickles home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Qingcheng Field Workshop also welcomed unexpectedly high traffic and popularity. Many people have eaten water caltrops, but few have seen what fresh water caltrops look like, and even fewer know how to peel them. The workshop team from Qingcheng, Kunshan, led everyone in learning about water caltrops, showing many interesting photos, and teaching everyone how to use \"copper fingers\" to peel water caltrops, experiencing what it means to \"work hard for every grain.\" After peeling the water caltrops, the children played interactive games and answered questions, and everyone on-site could enjoy a small cup of delicious and nutritious fresh water caltrop syrup.\n",

Walking across the grasslands, 37-year-old ecological caretaker Deqie Jia often contemplates how to durably protect the beautiful landscapes of his hometown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deqie Jia's home is located in Madoi County, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. This area is the core region of the Sanjiangyuan National Park's Yellow River Source Zone and an important ecological barrier on the Tibetan Plateau, known as the \"County of a Thousand Lakes.\" The lush grasslands nourish the people who have lived here for generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, due to global warming and overgrazing, by the early 21st century, the grasslands had severely degraded, lakes had shrunk, and wildlife populations had plummeted, leading to continuous ecological deterioration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the pilot work for the Sanjiangyuan National Park system began, and the Yellow River Source Zone fully implemented the \"one household, one post\" ecological caretaker policy, gradually transforming herders into ecological protectors. Deqie Jia took on a new identity as a \"homeland guardian\": \"We conduct at least three patrols of the grasslands each week, collecting garbage, monitoring and recording wild animals, and exchanging knowledge about grassland protection with each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, over 17,000 ecological caretakers, like Deqie Jia, are distributed across every corner of the Sanjiangyuan headwaters, protecting their homeland through their actions. \"It is the wish of every herder to use their own strength to make their homeland even more beautiful,\" Deqie Jia said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2021, China officially established its first five national parks, including Sanjiangyuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the establishment of the Sanjiangyuan National Park, we have continuously explored the construction of a natural protection system,\" said Sun Lijun, deputy director of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration. \"We have implemented ecological protection and restoration projects such as black soil beach governance, harmful organism control, and ecological protection along the Yellow River basin, striving to build a comprehensive, effective, and precise management system.\"\n",

      "Today, the snow-capped mountains stand majestically, lakes dot the landscape, and black-necked cranes and wild yaks, among other rare wildlife, make occasional appearances... The latest statistics show that the ecological environment in the Sanjiangyuan region has continued to improve, with a net increase of 309 square kilometers in the area of water bodies and wetlands, an annual increase of over 6% in water source conservation, and continuously improving biodiversity.\n",

      "Hainan's tropical rainforest harbors rich tropical biodiversity and genetic resources. In the past, due to the need for economic development, local areas engaged in uncontrolled resource extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the \"Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Pilot Program\" was issued, clearly requiring the gradual closure and relocation of mining companies within the national park that do not meet protection and planning requirements, and establishing a mechanism for the exit of existing mining rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does the national park have to do with us?\" \"Why remove the very 'money trees' that are doing well?\"... Hong Xiaojiang, then director of the Office of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Administration, recalls that complaints and objections were incessant at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff members persuasively explained, held face-to-face talks with companies, and coordinated at the site of mining operations, finally convincing the \"tough\" companies. By December 2021, all 10 mining rights within the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park had been abolished and exited, bringing long-awaited tranquility to the rainforest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the former mining companies have basically completed the ecological restoration of the mining areas, and the once-pockmarked mountains have regained their greenery. The dense forests, colorful sunsets, cascading waterfalls, and increasing footprints of various rare animals... The once-dreamlike secrets of the rainforest have become a reality.\n",

      "Feng Liming is the deputy director of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard Monitoring and Research Center under the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. According to him, in the past, due to the increase in human activities, the habitat of wild Northeast tigers disappeared and degraded, leading to a rapid decline in their population. By 1998, there were only 12 to 16 wild Northeast tigers left in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, the state successively adopted measures such as establishing nature reserves, halting commercial logging of natural forests, and clearing mountains of traps, achieving certain results but still facing challenges: the protection work involved multiple departments and administrative divisions, leading to a fragmented ecological system and serious fragmentation of Northeast tiger and leopard protection areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the pilot work for the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park began, spanning across Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and involving the transfer of administrative functions of seven departments, including land and forestry, to the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park Administration. Efforts such as forest vegetation restoration, the withdrawal of production and living activities from core areas, and the construction of corridors for tiger and leopard migration and dispersion are ongoing... All these measures aim to restore the forest's control to tigers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the \"sky-ground-integrated monitoring system\" allows real-time observation of the movements of Northeast tigers and leopards. The latest monitoring data shows that there are approximately 70 stable wild Northeast tigers and 80 wild Northeast leopards living in the park, with their activity ranges covering over 11,000 square kilometers, about 80% of the entire park area.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the past, due to natural and human factors, China's giant panda population was fragmented into multiple small groups, living in what seemed like isolated \"islands,\" hindering their reproduction and survival. By the end of 2013, the national wild giant panda population numbered 1,864 individuals, divided into 33 local populations, with 24 of these populations facing extinction risks due to their small numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the Giant Panda National Park was officially established. To enhance the gene exchange capacity of giant pandas, Sichuan area, including the Yingshi area, planned 10 giant panda ecological corridors, such as the Tuwu Mountain, Niuba Mountain, and Erlang Mountain corridors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wuyi Mountain National Park covers a total area of 1,280 square kilometers, spanning across Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. It is renowned for its rich biological resources and diverse biodiversity, as well as being the birthplace of oolong tea and black tea. Tea industry is one of the pillar industries here, and Li Wansong has been managing his tea garden for over 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In previous years, driven by economic interests, people often destroyed forests to plant tea, damaging the mountain's ecological environment, reducing species diversity, and weakening functions such as soil retention and air purification,\" Li Wansong said. \"Since the establishment of the national park, protection efforts have been strengthened, and the phenomenon of destroying forests for tea planting has been controlled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the idea that \"protecting the ecological environment is protecting our homeland\" has become a consensus among the people of Wuyi Mountain. After the establishment of Wuyi Mountain National Park, Li Wansong and the villagers became ecological forest rangers. \"Now, we use 'sky-ground' all-round, all-weather monitoring and management, with strong ecological protection capabilities,\" Li Wansong said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural ecological environment in the park has also continued to improve: in the Fujian area of the park, forest vegetation has accelerated its recovery, with a forest coverage rate of 96.72%; surface water and atmospheric indicators have all reached national first-class standards; and over 30 new species, including the Wuyi Mountain frog and Wuyi Mountain epiphytic orchid, have been discovered and announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "While safeguarding the beautiful ecology, the park actively promotes the integration of ecological protection, green development, and livelihood improvement, guiding tea farmers to build ecological tea gardens and promoting the fusion of tea culture, tea industry, and tea technology, enabling the people to enjoy more ecological benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With the increasingly better ecological environment, our village's 9,000-plus acres of tea mountains require no fertilization or pest control, and the quality of tea is getting better and better,\" Li Wansong said. \"Many first-time customers have become returning customers.\"\n",

      "Due to the ongoing public scrutiny of Xiaomi's traffic accident and the \"false advertising\" issue with its vehicle's front hood, on the evening of May 15th, Xiaomi Group (1810.HK) founder Lei Jun delivered an internal speech. In this speech, he reviewed the impact of the Xiaomi car accident, the social responsibilities that the Xiaomi Group, as a large company, needs to assume, and revealed the progress of the Xiaomi phone's SoC chip, Xuanjie O1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some voices express high expectations for Xiaomi's re-disclosure of its SoC chip, while others question the depth of Lei Jun's reflection. Within a year, Xiaomi Group's stock price has risen from a low of 15.36 Hong Kong dollars to a high of 59.45 Hong Kong dollars, and has been fluctuating recently due to issues with its car business. Supported by Xiaomi Group's diversified business and the brand image shaped by Lei Jun, there has not yet been a large-scale panic-driven stock sell-off in the secondary market. As of this writing, Xiaomi Group's stock price is 51.05 Hong Kong dollars, up 1.79%.\n",

      "Trying to handle everything at once will lead to failure in the most important matters. Lei Jun has previously stated that while investing half of his energy in the car business, he allocates approximately one-third of his focus to the phone business, as phones are the core of Xiaomi's business. However, when both phones and cars face intense competition, the allocation of the leader's energy becomes particularly crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fifteen years since Xiaomi's founding, regardless of the initial \"Eight Great Generals,\" the later-introduced external management team, or the young talent pipeline developed internally, Lei Jun has played a decisive role as a group brand symbol. To a certain extent, the Xiaomi brand is directly equated with Lei Jun himself. However, as the competitive landscape of incubated projects within the group becomes more severe, Lei Jun, who has claimed to \"bet everything,\" needs to seriously consider that not every success needs to be \"mine.\"\n",

      "On the evening of February 29th, an accident on the Anhui Dexing Expressway sent Xiaomi's car into a cooling period after months of high-profile marketing. The official investigation results of the traffic accident are yet to be released, and Xiaomi's car has again been embroiled in a controversy over false advertising of its carbon fiber front hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, one of the key selling points of the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra was its carbon fiber dual-intake front hood, priced at 42,000 yuan. Officially, it was touted as \"replicating the aerodynamics of the Nurburgring prototype,\" \"increasing downforce,\" and \"optimizing heat dissipation.\" However, after taking delivery, car owners found that the air intake openings could not blow a tissue, and upon disassembly, the internal structure was no different from an ordinary aluminum hood, not connected to the brake cooling system, and did not produce the advertised downforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facing the issues of reduced functionality and false advertising, some car owners initiated collective legal action, demanding refunds and compensation. On May 7th, Xiaomi Car officially issued an apology, acknowledging \"unclear information,\" and proposed a compensation plan: free replacement with an aluminum front hood for undelivered orders, and a gift of 20,000 points (approximately 2,000 yuan) for those who have taken delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this plan was not accepted by the car owners—replacement required re-queuing for over 30 weeks, the points compensation was only 4.7% of the optional equipment fee, and it did not cover the demand for refunds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang Xiang, director of the Vodafone Digital Automotive International Cooperation Research Center, told Yicai that some car companies, in pursuit of promotional effects, start advertising vehicle functions before the vehicles are actually produced and start accepting blind orders from customers. However, during the vehicle's development and production, there are many uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of social incidents also led Lei Jun to slow down his marketing activities on social media. In the retrospective speech on the 15th, Lei Jun said: \"At the end of March, a sudden traffic accident shattered everything. The company faced a storm of questions, criticism, and accusations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one expected the impact of this accident to be so great, and the blow to Xiaomi to be so severe,\" Lei Jun said, adding that the public's expectations and demands for Xiaomi far exceeded imagination. Given Xiaomi's current scale, influence, and level of public attention, society and the public expect Xiaomi to assume the responsibility of a true industry leader as a large company, which is a responsibility Xiaomi cannot avoid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lei Jun did not explicitly state the specific solutions and response measures but summarized them as \"technology-based.\" He mentioned that Xiaomi proposed to invest more than 100 billion yuan in research and development costs five years ago and is expected to invest more than 30 billion yuan this year. Additionally, Lei Jun revealed that Xiaomi's self-developed phone SoC chip, Xuanjie O1, will be released at the end of this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 16th, Lei Jun further elaborated on Xiaomi's history of chip development, stating that Xiaomi's chip research and development began in September 2014, and the first chip launch conference was held in February 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Xiaomi established Pinecone Electronics to embark on the path of self-developed chips. After 28 months, the entire process of developing, taping out, and mass-producing the Surge S1 was completed, and it was launched externally in 2017. Although it was only based on a 28nm process technology, Xiaomi's Surge S1 still made Xiaomi the fourth phone manufacturer to develop its own chip after Apple, Samsung, and Huawei.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, after the S1, the S2 did not arrive as scheduled, and Xiaomi's disclosures about its self-developed SoC chips have been stagnant until now. In March 2023, Xiaomi released the MIX FOLD foldable screen phone, which adopted a self-developed ISP (image signal processor) chip, \"Surge C1,\" for the first time. The ISP is independent of the SoC and is mounted on the motherboard. At that time, Lei Jun stated that this was just a small step in Xiaomi's continuous exploration of professional imaging, and that Xiaomi's chip-making journey had never stopped since the launch of its first chip seven years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, Lei Jun emphasized the significance of chip-making for Xiaomi: Many believe that making chips is a high-risk endeavor, but Xiaomi remains committed to it. In his view, chips are the pinnacle of phone technology, and Xiaomi must master core technologies. If Xiaomi wants to dominate the phone market, it must make long-term investments in chip technology.\n",

      "Whether it's investing in self-developed chips or car safety, Xiaomi Group currently faces pressure from multiple directions. Lei Jun, who holds multiple roles, also faces the dual challenges of the red sea of the phone business and the early stages of the car business. Prioritizing tasks, balancing personal energy and group resource allocation, is an urgent task for Lei Jun.\n",

      "On one hand, in the phone market, according to Canalys data, driven by national subsidies and overall consumer recovery, China's smartphone market has seen a moderate recovery, with a 5% year-on-year increase in shipments to 70.9 million units in the first quarter of 2025. Xiaomi's shipments reached 13.3 million units, a year-on-year increase of 40%. Benefiting from product and channel synergies, Xiaomi returned to the top position in China's smartphone market with a 19% market share and maintained its domestic goal of increasing market share by at least 1% annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the international market, excluding China's shipments, Xiaomi's phone shipments in overseas markets decreased by about 8.7% year-on-year. Canalys Chief Analyst Zhu Jiatao said: \"The smartphone situation in various regions is becoming complex. Regions such as India, Latin America, and the Middle East, which have shown strong growth over the past year, have seen significant declines, indicating saturation of upgrade demands in the mass product segment. Most Android brands are actively adjusting their inventory levels in the first quarter to avoid affecting new machine launches and channel price systems. The European market, after a brief recovery, has fallen again, with manufacturers facing high inventory levels of flagship models from the end of last year and disruptions to future mid-to-low-end product lines due to the eco-design directive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In China's domestic new energy vehicle market, although relevant departments have proposed to further strengthen market supervision and rectify illegal marketing chaos, the close-quarters battle is far from over, and price wars are ongoing. According to insurance data provided by Li Yanwei, an expert at the China Automotive Distribution Association, Xiaomi Car's sales have declined for three consecutive weeks. Regarding Xiaomi Car's recent sales trend, Wang Hua, General Manager of Xiaomi Group's Public Relations Department, said that cyclical factors should be considered. However, whether it's phones or cars, they are both in critical stages where no single person can determine victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lei Jun, since Xiaomi officially announced its car business, his focus and energy have gradually shifted from phones to cars. However, as Lei Jun stated in his 2024 annual speech: The Xiaomi SU7 is just the beginning of Xiaomi Car's journey to the table, but there is a long way to go before real success is achieved. Xiaomi Car's \"Long March\" has only just begun.\n",

      "Official WeChat Official Weibo Indonesian Telin, South Korea's KT, and an unnamed Japanese partner have agreed to build a new submarine fiber-optic cable system that will connect South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries in the region. Known as ALPHA (Advanced Performance Fiber-Optic Cable System for High-Speed Access in Asia), it will have at least 8 pairs of fibers, each designed to carry a capacity of 18 Tbits/s. The Memorandum of Understanding for the ALPHA project was signed by Telin CEO Budi Satria Dharma Purba and KT Senior Vice President Joon Myung. The two companies stated that they aim to complete the project plan this year, including determining the best route for the next-generation technology and system. The ALPHA submarine cable system is expected to enter service in the first quarter of 2027. President Myung stated, \"KT's ALPHA submarine cable construction is a significant leap to promptly meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud, big data, and AI traffic from corporate customers in the rapidly growing Asian region.\" He added that the company will also continue to expand its influence in the Asian submarine cable market by \"strengthening partnerships with like-minded global companies.\" Both KT and Telin believe that the explosive growth of internet traffic across the entire region is the main driving force behind the construction of a new intra-Asian cable connecting the East and Southeast Asian regions, with the largest volume of traffic currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific. The companies cited data from 451Research indicating that data center capacity in Malaysia, Indonesia, and India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% to 25% over the next five years. These countries share several advantages, including growing online businesses, locally customized content, and a young demographic structure. Telin aims to position Indonesia as a center for intra-Asian interconnectivity through its collaboration with KT on the ALPHA submarine cable system.\n",

      "In pushing forward the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, we should take the learning and application of the experience of the \"Thousand and Ten Thousand Engineering\" project as a guide. During his time in Zhejiang, General Secretary Xi Jinping personally planned and promoted the \"Thousand Model Villages, Ten Thousand Villages to be Improved\" project. After more than 20 years of continuous efforts, it not only brought about profound changes in the overall face of Zhejiang's countryside but also made pioneering explorations and demonstrated leadership in advancing the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, which can be learned from and emulated by other regions. We should learn from the development philosophy, work methods, and promotion mechanisms inherent in the \"Thousand and Ten Thousand Engineering\" project, start from the practical problems that farmers and villagers reflect strongly on, find the entry point for rural revitalization, proceed from local conditions, seek practical effects, and concentrate efforts to accomplish a series of tangible and accessible real affairs for the masses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pushing forward the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, we must firmly safeguard two bottom lines: ensuring national food security and preventing large-scale return to poverty. When there is food in hand, there is no need to worry. To ensure national food security, we should adhere to stabilizing acreage and increasing per-unit yield, effectively mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for planting and local enthusiasm for grain production, earnestly implement the production of grain and important agricultural products, and solidly advance the new round of the thousand-billion-jin increase in grain production capacity. We should establish a system of protecting cultivated land in terms of quantity, quality, and ecology, ensure that grain output remains above 1.3 trillion jin, build a diversified food supply system, and further stabilize and improve the Chinese people's rice bowl. We should implement the monitoring and assistance mechanism to prevent returning to poverty, tighten the responsibilities for preventing returning to poverty, continue to strengthen industrial and employment assistance, increase support for key areas, improve development conditions, enhance \"blood-building\" capabilities, and stimulate endogenous motivation to continuously consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation and ensure no large-scale return to poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pushing forward the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, we should focus on elevating the levels of rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance as key tasks. Rural areas are not only the spatial carriers of agricultural production but also the hometowns where most farmers are born and raised. To elevate the level of rural industrial development, we should promote the integrated development of rural primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, tap into the potential of local specialties, adhere to industrial, quality, and green development of agriculture, and accelerate the construction of a modern rural industrial system that combines agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, integrates production, processing, and sales, and fuses agriculture with culture and tourism. To elevate the level of rural construction, we should enhance the guiding role of rural planning, adapt to the changing trends of the rural population, optimize village layout, industrial structure, and public service allocation, and coordinate the new urbanization and the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas. To elevate the level of rural governance, we should promote party building to drive rural revitalization, develop rural culture, continuously advance rural social customs reform, adhere to and develop the \"Fengqiao Experience\" of the new era, and build a peaceful countryside. By coordinating the promotion of rural industrial development, rural construction, and rural governance, we can continuously create a good environment for living and working in peace and contentment, enabling farmers to have a stronger sense of gain, happiness, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pushing forward the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, technology is a powerful tool, and reform is a treasure. We should strengthen the dual-wheel drive of technology and reform, optimize the strategic layout of agricultural technological innovation, intensify the breakthrough of key core technologies in seed sources, strengthen rural reform and innovation, enhance the integrated and enhanced effects of reform measures, and invigorate the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas with technological and reform vitality. \"When the people throughout the country are prosperous, the country will be in order.\" Increasing farmers' income is the central task of the \"three rural\" work. We should implement the action to promote farmers' income growth, continuously develop rural wealth-building industries, strengthen the linkage of industrial development with farmers, enhance vocational skills training for migrant workers, promote multi-channel employment of rural labor, open up more income channels, and make farmers' wallets thicker and their lives better day by day.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and is a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. The \"three rural\" work is glorious in mission and momentous in responsibility. Let us, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, keep our eyes on the goal of building an agricultural power, have full confidence, muster our strength, and work hard to implement the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements for the \"three rural\" work with a spirit of pragmatism, pushing the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas to achieve new results and steadily moving towards the goal of building an agricultural power.\n",

      "In 2021, we fully experienced the powerful momentum of the digital wave. As society as a whole accelerates its march towards digitalization, networking, and intelligence, the importance of constructing new types of information infrastructure, represented by IPv6, is becoming increasingly prominent. Over the past year, thanks to effective policy guidance and the concerted efforts of the entire industry, China's large-scale deployment of IPv6 has achieved remarkable results, with IPv6 traffic increasing significantly, IPv6-based application innovations emerging one after another, and the \"IPv6+\" innovation system accelerating its construction, providing strong support for the building of a cyberpower and a digital China, and boosting the vigorous development of the digital economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three-year plan outlines a blueprint for large-scale IPv6 deployment.\n",
      "2021 was a special year for China's IPv6 development. In this year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) officially released the \"Special Action Plan for IPv6 Traffic Enhancement over Three Years (2021-2023)\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Three-Year Action Plan\"), clarifying the key development tasks for the next three years. This marks the official entry of China's IPv6 development into the \"traffic enhancement\" era after passing through critical stages such as network readiness and end-to-end connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "IPv6 large-scale deployment and application are the inevitable trends of the Internet's evolution and upgrade, an important direction for network technology innovation, and a key support for building a cyberpower. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the \"Action Plan for the Large-Scale Deployment of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)\" in 2017, the MIIT has successively organized a series of special actions such as \"IPv6 Network Readiness,\" \"IPv6 End-to-End Connectivity,\" and \"IPv6 Traffic Enhancement.\" In July 2021, the MIIT officially released the \"Three-Year Action Plan,\" pushing the development of the IPv6 industry into a new stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Three-Year Action Plan\" focuses on the overall goal of enhancing IPv6 traffic and proposes quantitative targets from aspects such as the performance of network and application infrastructure services, the IPv6 concentration of major commercial Internet applications, and the proportion of IPv6-supporting terminal devices. For instance, by the end of 2023, the proportion of IPv6 traffic in mobile networks will increase from 20% in 2021 to 50%, and the IPv6 concentration of the top 100 commercial Internet applications by user volume will increase from 40% in 2021 to 70%. Industry insiders believe that the \"Three-Year Action Plan\" sets quantitative targets for the key points and pain points of IPv6 industry development, which has significant guidance for industrial development.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better promote the implementation of the \"Three-Year Action Plan,\" on August 25, 2021, the MIIT held a national deployment and interpretation meeting on the special action plan for IPv6 traffic enhancement over three years, interpreting and deploying policies to the entire industry. More than 50 representatives from industry enterprises, including the communications administrations of 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the industrial and information technology competent departments attended the meeting, reaching a consensus and accelerating the large-scale deployment of IPv6.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2021, the MIIT issued a notice on strengthening and standardizing the management of radio waves in the 2400MHz, 5100MHz, and 5800MHz frequency bands, incorporating the IPv6 support status of home wireless routers into the radio model approval monitoring requirements, clearing the last 100 meters of IPv6 traffic enhancement terminal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the IPv6 standard planning work also entered a new stage. On September 1, 2021, under the guidance of departments such as the MIIT, the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the State Administration for Market Regulation, the China Communications Standards Association led the establishment of the IPv6 Standard Working Group. Industry insiders believe that the establishment of the IPv6 Standard Working Group will gather the strengths of industry, academia, research, and application to accelerate the domestic and international standardization process of IPv6, which is of great significance for promoting IPv6 technology and industrial development.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that in November 2021, the MIIT officially issued the \"Information and Communication Industry Development Plan for the 14th Five-Year Plan,\" clearly stating that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, efforts will be made to enhance IPv6 end-to-end connectivity, improve IPv6 network performance and service level, and achieve dual growth in IPv6 user scale and business traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial synergy yields significant IPv6 traffic enhancement results.\n",
      "The release of the \"Three-Year Action Plan\" ignited the confidence and enthusiasm of the industry to accelerate the \"traffic enhancement\" of IPv6. Under the effective guidance of policies, basic telecom enterprises, Internet companies, CDN manufacturers, and terminal manufacturers have vigorously promoted the upgrade and transformation of networks, businesses, and terminals, and the results of large-scale deployment are becoming increasingly apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since July 2021, the four major basic telecom enterprises—China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Broadcasting Network—have further accelerated the pace of infrastructure transformation. Based on the comprehensive completion of IPv6 upgrades for 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband networks, they have continued to promote the transformation and upgrading of data centers, CDNs, and cloud networks, and in combination with the landing of \"dual gigabit\" and other businesses, they have accelerated the replacement of old and obsolete broadband terminals, contributing to the scale enhancement of IPv6 traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Internet companies and CDN enterprises such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and NetEase Technology have continued to promote the transformation of cloud, IDC, and CDN infrastructure, strengthening the support for related businesses with IPv6. Companies such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Meituan, Qihoo 360, and NetEase have continuously carried out APP transformations to improve the IPv6 concentration of APP applications. Terminal manufacturers such as Xiaomi, H3C, and JiXingTengDa have increased the intensity of IPv6 transformation for both in-sale and under-research products.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the joint efforts of the industry, China's IPv6 \"traffic enhancement\" has achieved significant results. At the \"2021 China IPv6 Innovation and Development Conference\" held on October 11, 2021, Han Xia, Chief Engineer of the MIIT, announced to the industry that China's mobile network IPv6 traffic has grown from zero to 22.87%, exceeding the annual target in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest data shows that by the end of 2021, the proportion of IPv6 traffic in China's mobile networks had increased from 17.21% at the end of 2020 to 35.15%, and the proportion of IPv6 traffic in fixed networks had increased from 4.3% at the end of 2020 to 9.38%, both achieving year-on-year doubling growth and exceeding the predetermined targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration and empowerment: the \"IPv6+\" innovation system takes initial shape.\n",
      "As IPv6 large-scale deployment accelerates, IPv6 innovation is also picking up speed. The \"Three-Year Action Plan\" clearly requires the gradual and orderly promotion of \"IPv6+\" network and technological innovation. The \"Information and Communication Industry Development Plan for the 14th Five-Year Plan\" also explicitly states that support will be provided for the pilot and large-scale application of \"IPv6+\" innovative technologies in key industries such as finance, energy, transportation, education, and government affairs, enhancing the ability of IPv6 networks to support the digital transformation and upgrading of industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the entire industry accelerated the construction of the \"IPv6+\" innovation system, and a series of achievements were implemented across the country. At the \"IPv6+ Innovation City Summit Forum\" held on September 10, the \"IPv6+ Innovation City\" was established in Shanghai, which will build a new generation of information infrastructure system with high speed, mobility, ubiquity, and intelligence as its prominent features by 2025. At the \"6th IPv6+ Industry Forum\" held on September 27, SAIC Motor and China Telecom jointly released the \"IPv6+ Industrial Intelligent Cloud Network Technology White Paper.\" In October, Wuhan became the first city in the country to launch large-scale IPv6 deployment, accelerating the construction of the \"IPv6+\" digital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accelerate the integration of IPv6 into various industries, in October 2021, the first \"Guanghua Cup\" Terabit Optical Network Application Innovation Competition, guided by the MIIT, was officially launched, setting the \"IPv6+\" technological innovation application as a separate track. In November 2021, the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the MIIT, and other departments carried out the work of IPv6 technology and innovative fusion application pilot, accelerating the empowerment of IPv6 applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, the \"IPv6+\" has accelerated its landing in industries such as finance, education, healthcare, and energy, driving the digital transformation of various industries. For example, Guangdong Province has actively explored the application of \"IPv6+\" in the government extranet, setting a benchmark for the provincial full-scenario \"IPv6+\" government extranet. The State Grid North China Electric Power Company has deployed \"IPv6+\" innovative technologies in its network, significantly improving its network autonomous decision-making capability and intelligence level. China Construction Bank has completed IPv6 transformation and put into production more than 90 Internet systems and core network 2.0 systems, and innovatively used \"IPv6+\" technologies, significantly improving network delivery capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an indispensable \"network foundation\" in the era of digital economy, the large-scale deployment of IPv6 is of great significance. Currently, China's IPv6 user and network scale are among the world's leading, and the capacity for IPv6 traffic and business carrying has also been significantly enhanced. With the full opening of the \"traffic enhancement\" era, China's IPv6 development will further accelerate, providing strong support for the digital transformation of thousands of industries and businesses, and injecting strong momentum into the construction of a cyberpower and the expansion of the digital economy.\n",

State Council Issues Another Guiding Document on Capital Market, Strengthening Regulation and Risk Prevention, Driving High-Quality Development of Capital Market — An Exclusive Interview with Wu Qing, Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of CSRC on Implementing the Third \"State Nine Articles\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the State Council issued \"Several Opinions on Strengthening Regulation, Preventing Risks, and Driving High-Quality Development of the Capital Market.\" The opinions, consisting of nine parts, serve as the third \"State Nine Articles\" for the capital market. On December 12th, Wu Qing, Secretary of the Party Committee and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), accepted an exclusive interview from journalists on implementing these opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another 10 Years Have Passed for the State Council to Issue Guiding Documents on Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How do you interpret the significant meaning of the opinions' issuance?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The opinions issued by the State Council deeply embody President Xi Jinping's important instructions on the capital market and implement the arrangements of the Central Financial Work Conference. This is the third \"State Nine Articles\" following those issued in 2004 and 2014, marking another 10 years for the State Council to issue guiding documents on the capital market. This fully demonstrates the high importance and keen expectations placed on the capital market by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the previous two \"State Nine Articles,\" the main characteristics of the newly issued opinions are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fully embodying the political and people-oriented nature of the capital market. Emphasis is placed on upholding and strengthening the comprehensive leadership of the Party over capital market work, adhering to a people-centered value orientation, and effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fully reflecting the main line of strengthening regulation, preventing risks, and promoting high-quality development. The focus should be on stability, strengthening the foundation and fundamentals, strict supervision and management, and driving the high-quality development of the capital market itself to better serve the overall high-quality development of the economy and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fully reflecting goal-oriented and problem-oriented approaches. Especially in response to prominent issues exposed by the stock market fluctuations since last August, such as institutional mechanisms and regulatory enforcement, timely measures will be taken to address shortcomings and strengthen weak links, responding to investors' concerns and accelerating the resolution of deep-rooted contradictions accumulated in the capital market over a long period, with the goal of building a safe, standardized, transparent, open, vibrant, and resilient capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals set for capital market development are progressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How do you understand the goals for capital market development proposed for the coming period?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to comprehensively advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization. The Central Financial Work Conference put forward the goal of accelerating the construction of a financial power. A strong capital market is a standard feature of a modern economy. Driving the high-quality development of the capital market is favorable for promoting high-level circulation among science and technology, industry, and capital, perfecting the modern industrial system, and driving the development of new types of productive forces; it is also beneficial for enriching financial products and services, creating more opportunities for residents to increase their property income; and it supports the development of equity financing, optimizing the financing structure, and perfecting China's modern financial system with Chinese characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"State Nine Articles\" focus on Chinese-style modernization and anchor on the goal of building a financial power. They propose progressive goals for the capital market's development in the next 5 years, by 2035, and in the middle of this century. From aspects such as investor protection, listed company quality, development of industry institutions, regulatory capacity, and governance system construction, a blueprint for development is outlined. We understand that this series of development goals is systematic and comprehensive, as well as progressive. It is necessary to remain unwavering in the direction of market-oriented and rule-of-law reforms, respect laws and rules, implement step-by-step practices, persist in long-term efforts, and unwaveringly turn the blueprint into reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing the opinions will form a \"1+N\" policy system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How will the CSRC systematically promote the implementation of the policy measures proposed in the opinions?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The new \"State Nine Articles\" adhere to a systematic approach, combining short-term and long-term goals, and comprehensive policy measures. Together with the implementation arrangements organized by the CSRC in conjunction with relevant parties, they form a \"1+N\" policy system, where \"1\" refers to the opinions themselves, and \"N\" refers to several supporting regulations and rules. Last month, we already released four policy documents on strict entry standards for IPOs, strengthening ongoing supervision of listed companies, and other aspects. Today, we will release a policy document on strengthening delisting supervision and publicly solicit opinions on six specific regulations and rules. Exchanges will also solicit opinions on a batch of self-regulatory rules simultaneously. In the next step, based on in-depth research, we will study and formulate reform measures to promote the long-term development of the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main line of the \"1+N\" policy system is strengthening regulation, preventing risks, and promoting high-quality development. This is an organic whole that complements each other, and must be promoted and implemented systematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of strengthening regulation, we will build an all-round, three-dimensional capital market regulatory system, fully implementing strict and effective regulation. The supervision of listed companies should focus on full-chain supervision and enhancing the investment value of listed companies, continuously exerting efforts in three aspects: strict IPO standards, strict ongoing supervision, and intensified delisting supervision. Institutional supervision should promote a return to the source, excel in strength, further press \"gatekeeper\" responsibilities, and guide securities, futures, funds, and other types of industry institutions to correct their business philosophies, enhance compliance levels, professional service capabilities, and core competitiveness. We will actively cultivate the concepts of rational investment, value investment, and long-term investment, as well as a healthy investment culture. Trading supervision should promote fairness and efficiency, regulate the trading behaviors of various entities and funds, severely crack down on illegal and irregular activities that disrupt the market, and maintain an open, fair, and just order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of risk prevention, we will propose a series of institutional arrangements and policy measures from aspects such as maintaining market stability, preventing and resolving risks in key areas, improving expectation management mechanisms, and coordinating openness with security. Especially, we need to enhance the inherent stability of the capital market, perfect risk monitoring and disposal mechanisms, and focus on stabilizing confidence and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In driving high-quality development, we will earnestly implement the requirements of doing well in the five major tasks of finance as proposed at the Central Financial Work Conference. We will further improve the multi-level capital market system, enhance the adaptability and inclusiveness of capital market institutions, promote capital formation, better serve innovations in new industries, new business models, and new technologies, and effectively promote the development of new types of productive forces. Currently, we are conducting a comprehensive assessment of capital market reforms, widely collecting opinions and suggestions from all parties, and researching improvements to relevant regulations and rules to continuously deepen important systemic reforms such as the registration system for stock issuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forming an effective governance structure for the capital market with joint construction, governance, and sharing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Driving the high-quality development of the capital market relies on the combined efforts of all parties. What arrangements are there in the opinions in this regard?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The capital market involves numerous participants and complex operational mechanisms. In a good market ecosystem, institutional investors and individual investors grow together, various funds, whether long-term or short-term, find their appropriate positions, issuers and investors achieve mutual success, all market participants fulfill their responsibilities, and regulation interacts positively with the market. This requires all relevant parties to jointly grasp the balance between financing and investment, primary and secondary markets, entry and exit, and on-exchange and off-exchange activities, forming an effective governance structure for the capital market with joint construction, governance, and sharing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new \"State Nine Articles\" make arrangements for many key aspects. For instance, promoting the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market emphasizes not only the development of equity-type public funds as the \"base,\" but also focuses on creating a policy environment that attracts, retains, and facilitates the development of insurance funds, social security funds, pension funds, and other long-term funds. Specific arrangements are made for different types of funds. Another example is the emphasis on strengthening the rule of law, where a series of hard measures are proposed to significantly increase the costs of illegal and irregular activities in the capital market, perfecting a three-dimensional accountability system consisting of administrative, criminal, and civil liabilities. We believe that as long as we persistently work on these issues, the capital market will become even cleaner and more stable. Additionally, the opinions require deepening coordination and linkage between central and local governments and between ministries. We will continue to strengthen work coordination with all parties, promoting the formation of a powerful force to drive the high-quality development of the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a regulatory force that is politically, competitively, and morally strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: The opinions propose requirements for strengthening the CSRC's self-construction, and the CSRC has also issued relevant documents. What specific measures are there in this regard?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: To forge a sword, one must first sharpen the blade. The new \"State Nine Articles\" clearly propose requirements for strengthening the construction of the regulatory team, and we have already made arrangements accordingly. We will further emphasize strengthening political construction, continuously consolidating and expanding the achievements of studying and implementing President Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, deeply advancing comprehensive and strict Party management, and resolutely implementing the requirements of strict and effective regulation with a blade that is sharp and pointed. We will enhance the comprehensive strictness of self-construction to drive the comprehensive strictness of regulatory work. We will strengthen coordination and linkage with the on-site discipline inspection and supervision team, solidly advance central inspection rectification, focus on removing the soil conditions for corruption, and integrate the \"three impossibles\" — daring not to be corrupt, unable to be corrupt, and unwilling to be corrupt. On prominent issues that attract attention from all parties, such as the \"revolving door\" between politics and business and escape-style resignations, we have already introduced over 20 measures, implementing comprehensive policies from both the business and management ends. We will further deepen special governance in these areas, persist until success, and never be lenient. In general, we will strive to build a regulatory force that is politically, competitively, and morally strong, providing strong support for strengthening regulation, preventing risks, and driving the high-quality development of the capital market.\n",

CITIC Securities indicated that the policy combination of \"no change in the 1-year rate + a cut in the 5-year rate\" may aim to protect banks' net interest margins. Hai Tong Securities also noted that policymakers would consider the balance between residents' debt burden and banks' profitability, with market expectations of deposit marketization.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the third quarter of 2023, commercial banks' net interest margins had narrowed to 1.73%, facing significant pressure. Despite another cut in bank deposit rates at the end of last year, given the time lag in adjusting fixed deposit rates and the increasing trend of deposit regularization, current cost pressure on banks' liability side remains considerable. Hai Tong Securities speculates that the central bank may continue to push for deposit rate reform, further reducing costs on the liability side for financial institutions and alleviating net interest margin pressure.\n",
